## [0.4.8] - 2025-11-10

### Added

- **GitignoreManager Module** – New centralized system for managing .gitignore entries for AI agent directories, replacing fragmented approach.
- **Comprehensive Agent Protection** – Auto-protect ALL 12 AI agent directories (.claude/, .codex/, .opencode/, etc.) in .gitignore during init, not just selected ones.
- **Duplicate Detection** – Smart duplicate detection prevents .gitignore pollution when running init multiple times.
- **Cross-Platform Support** – Line ending preservation ensures .gitignore works correctly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Changed

- **init Command Behavior** – Now automatically protects all AI agent directories instead of just selected ones, ensuring no sensitive data is accidentally committed.
- **Error Messages** – Improved error messages for permission issues with clear remediation steps (e.g., "Run: chmod u+w .gitignore").

### Fixed

- **Dashboard Markdown Rendering** – Fixed issue where .md files in Research and Contracts tabs were not rendered, now properly displays formatted markdown content.
- **Dashboard CSV Display** – Fixed CSV files not rendering in dashboard, now displays as formatted tables with proper styling and hover effects.

### Security

- **Agent Directory Protection** – All 12 known AI agent directories are now automatically added to .gitignore during init, preventing accidental commit of API keys, auth tokens, and other sensitive data.
- **Special .github/ Handling** – Added warning for .github/ directory which is used both by GitHub Copilot and GitHub Actions, reminding users to review before committing.

### Removed

- **Legacy Functions** – Removed `handle_codex_security()` and `ensure_gitignore_entries()` functions, replaced by comprehensive GitignoreManager class.

## [0.4.7] - 2025-11-07

### Added

- **Dashboard Diagnostics Page** – New diagnostics page showing real-time environment analysis, artifact location mismatches, and actionable recommendations.
- **CLI verify-setup Command** – New `spec-kitty verify-setup` command for comprehensive environment diagnostics in the terminal.
- **Worktree-Aware Resolution** – Added `resolve_worktree_aware_feature_dir()` function that intelligently detects and prefers worktree locations.
- **Agent Location Checks** – Standardized "CRITICAL: Location Requirement" sections in command templates with bash verification scripts.
- **Test Coverage** – Added comprehensive test suite for gitignore management and Codex security features with 9 test cases covering all edge cases.

### Changed

- **Command Templates** – Enhanced plan.md and tasks.md with explicit worktree location requirements and verification scripts.
- **Error Messages** – Improved bash script errors with visual indicators (❌ ERROR, 🔧 TO FIX, 💡 TIP) and exact fix commands.
- **Research Command** – Updated to use worktree-aware feature directory resolution.
- **Refactored Codex Security** – Extracted Codex credential protection logic into a dedicated `handle_codex_security()` function for better maintainability and testability.

### Fixed

- **Artifact Location Mismatch** – Fixed issue where agents create artifacts in wrong location, preventing them from appearing in dashboard.

## [0.4.5] - 2025-11-06

### Added

- **Agent Guidance** – Bundled a shared `AGENTS.md` ruleset that is copied into `.kittify/` so every generated command has a canonical place to point agents for path/encoding/git expectations.
- **Encoding Toolkit** – Introduced `scripts/validate_encoding.py` and new documentation to scan/fix Windows-1252 artifacts, plus a non-interactive init guide in `docs/non-interactive-init.md`.
- **Dashboard Assets** – Split the inline dashboard UI into static CSS/JS files and committed them with the release.

### Changed

- **CLI Help & Docs** – Expanded `spec-kitty init`, `research`, `check`, `accept`, and `merge` help text and refreshed README/index links to render correctly on PyPI.
- **Dashboard Runtime** – Hardened the dashboard server/CLI handshake with health checks, token-gated shutdown, and more resilient worktree detection.
- **Mission Handling** – Improved mission activation to fall back gracefully when symlinks are unavailable (e.g., Windows w/out dev mode) and aligned shell helpers with the new logic.

### Security

- **Codex Guardrails** – Automatically append `.codex/` to `.gitignore`, warn if `auth.json` is tracked, and reiterate the `CODEX_HOME` workflow to keep API credentials out of source control.

## [0.4.6] - 2025-11-06

### Fixed

- **PyYAML Dependency** – Added `pyyaml` to the core dependency list so mission loading works in clean environments (CI no longer fails installing the package).
- **PyPI README Links** – Restored absolute documentation links to keep images and references working on PyPI.

## [0.4.4] - 2025-11-06

### Security

- **Credential Cleanup** – Removed the committed `.codex` directory (OpenAI credentials) from the entire Git history and regenerated sanitized release assets.
- **Token Rotation** – Documented that all compromised keys were revoked and environments refreshed before reissuing packages.

### Changed

- **Release Artifacts** – Rebuilt GitHub release bundles and PyPI distributions from the cleaned history to ensure no secrets are present in published archives.

## [0.3.2] - 2025-11-03

### Added

- **Automated PyPI Release Pipeline** – Tag-triggered GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds, validates, and publishes releases to PyPI using `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret, eliminating manual publish steps.
- **Release Validation Tooling** – `scripts/release/validate_release.py` CLI enforces semantic version progression, changelog completeness, and version/tag alignment in both branch and tag modes with actionable error messages.

### Changed

- **GitHub Actions Workflows** – Updated `release.yml` with pinned dependency versions, proper workflow ordering (PyPI publish before GitHub Release), and checksums stored in `dist/SHA256SUMS.txt`.
- **Workflow Reliability** – Fixed heredoc syntax error in `protect-main.yml` that was causing exit code 127 failures.

### Security

- **Secret Hygiene** – PyPI credentials exclusively stored in GitHub Actions secrets with rotation guidance; no tokens in repository or logs; workflows sanitize outputs.
- **Workflow Permissions** – Explicit least-privilege permissions in all workflows (contents:write, id-token:write for releases; contents:read for guards).

## [0.3.1] - 2025-11-03

### Changed

- **Worktree-Aware Merge Flow** – `/spec-kitty merge` now detects when it is invoked from a Git worktree, runs the actual merge steps from the primary repository checkout, and surfaces clearer guidance when the target checkout is dirty.

### Documentation

- **Merge Workflow Guidance** – Updated templates and Claude workflow docs to describe the primary-repo hand-off during merges and reinforce the feature-worktree best practice.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-02

### Added

- **pip Installation Instructions** – All documentation now includes pip installation commands alongside uv, making Spec Kitty accessible to users who prefer traditional Python package management.
- **Multiple Installation Methods** – Documented three installation paths: PyPI (stable), GitHub (development), and one-time usage (pipx/uvx).

### Changed

- **Documentation Consistency** – Updated README.md, docs/index.md, docs/installation.md, and docs/quickstart.md to provide both pip and uv commands throughout.
- **Installation Recommendations** – PyPI installation now marked as recommended for stable releases, with GitHub source for development versions.

### Fixed

- **Packaging Issues** – Removed duplicate `.kittify` force-include that caused "Duplicate filename in local headers" errors on PyPI.

- **Workflow Permissions** – Explicit least-privilege permissions in all workflows (contents:write, id-token:write for releases; contents:read for guards).

## [0.2.3] - 2025-10-29

### Added

- **Mission system assets** – Bundled Software Dev Kitty and Deep Research Kitty mission definitions (commands, templates, constitutions) directly in the CLI package so `spec-kitty init` can hydrate missions without a network call.

### Changed

- Synced mission templates between the repository and packaged wheel to keep `/spec-kitty.*` commands consistent across `--ai` choices.

## [0.2.2] - 2025-10-29

### Added

- **Phase 0 Research command** – `spec-kitty research` (and `/spec-kitty.research`) scaffolds `research.md`, `data-model.md`, and CSV evidence logs using mission-aware templates so Deep Research Kitty teams can execute discovery workflows without leaving the guided process.
- **Mission templates for research** – Deep Research Kitty now ships reusable templates for research decisions, data models, and evidence capture packaged inside the Python wheel.

### Changed

- Updated `spec-kitty init` guidance, plan command instructions, and README workflow to include the new research phase between planning and task generation.

## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-29

### Added

- **Mission picker in init** - `spec-kitty init` now prompts for a mission (or accepts `--mission`) so projects start with Software Dev Kitty, Deep Research Kitty, or another bundled mission and record the choice in `.kittify/active-mission`.

### Changed

- Highlight the active mission in the post-init guidance while keeping the Codex export step as the final instruction.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-28

### Added

- **New `/spec-kitty.merge` command** - Completes the workflow by merging features into main branch and cleaning up worktrees automatically. Supports multiple merge strategies (merge, squash, rebase), optional push to origin, and configurable cleanup of worktrees and branches.
- **Worktree Strategy documentation** - Added comprehensive guide to the opinionated worktree approach for parallel feature development.
- **Dashboard screenshots** - Added dashboard-kanban.png and dashboard-overview.png showcasing the real-time kanban board.
- **Real-Time Dashboard section** - Added prominent dashboard documentation "above the fold" in README with screenshots and feature highlights.
- **Mission management CLI** - `spec-kitty mission list|current|switch|info` for inspecting and activating domain-specific missions inside a project.
- **Deep Research Kitty mission** - Research-focused templates (spec, plan, tasks, findings, prompts) and command guardrails for evidence-driven work.
- **Mission packaging** - Missions are now bundled in release archives and Python wheels so project initialization copies `.kittify/missions` automatically.

### Changed

- Updated command list in init output to show workflow order and include merge command.
- Updated `/spec-kitty.accept` description to clarify it verifies (not merges) features.
- Reordered slash commands documentation to reflect actual execution workflow.
- Updated maintainers to reflect fork ownership (Robert Douglass).
- Updated all repository references from `spec-kitty/spec-kitty` to `Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty`.
- Updated installation instructions to use GitHub repository URL instead of local directory.

### Fixed

- Removed invalid `multiple=True` parameter from `typer.Option()` in accept command that caused TypeError on CLI startup.
- Fixed "nine articles" claim in spec-driven.md to "core articles" (only 6 are documented).

### Removed

- Removed SECURITY.md (GitHub-specific security policies).
- Removed CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (GitHub-specific contact information).
- Removed video overview section from README (outdated content).
- Removed plant emoji (🌱) branding from all documentation and code.
- Replaced logo_small.webp and logo_large.webp with actual spec-kitty cat logo.

## [0.1.3] - 2025-10-28

### Fixed

- Removed invalid `multiple=True` parameter from `typer.Option()` in accept command that caused TypeError on CLI startup.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-10-28

### Changed

- Rebranded the CLI command prefix from `speckitty` to `spec-kitty`, including package metadata and documentation references.
- Migrated template directories from `.specify` to `.kittify` and feature storage from `/specs` to `/kitty-specs` to avoid namespace conflicts with Spec Kit.
- Updated environment variables, helper scripts, and dashboards to align with the new `.kittify` and `kitty-specs` conventions.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-07

### Added

- New `/spec-kitty.accept` command (and `spec-kitty accept`) for feature-level acceptance: validates kanban state, frontmatter metadata, and artifacts; records acceptance metadata in `meta.json`; prints merge/cleanup instructions; and supports PR or local workflows across every agent.
- Acceptance helper scripts (`accept-feature.sh` / `.ps1`) and expanded `tasks_cli` utilities (`status`, `verify`, `accept`) for automation and integration with AI agents.
- Worktree-aware bootstrap workflow now defaults to creating per-feature worktrees, enabling parallel feature development with isolated sandboxes.
- Implementation prompts now require operating inside the feature’s worktree and rely on the lane helper scripts for moves/metadata, eliminating `git mv` conflicts; the dashboard also surfaces active/expected worktree paths.

### Changed

- `/spec-kitty.specify`, `/spec-kitty.plan`, and `/spec-kitty.clarify` now run fully conversational interviews—asking one question at a time, tracking internal coverage without rendering markdown tables, and only proceeding once summaries are confirmed—while continuing to resolve helper scripts via the `.kittify/scripts/...` paths.
- Added proportionality guidance so discovery, planning, and clarification depth scales with feature complexity (e.g., lightweight tic-tac-toe flows vs. an operating system build).
- `/spec-kitty.tasks` now produces both `tasks.md` and the kanban prompt files in one pass; the separate `/spec-kitty.task-prompts` command has been removed.
- Tasks are grouped into at most ten work packages with bundled prompts, reducing file churn and making prompt generation LLM-friendly.
- Both shell and PowerShell feature bootstrap scripts now stop with guidance to return `WAITING_FOR_DISCOVERY_INPUT` when invoked without a confirmed feature description, aligning with the new discovery workflow.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-07

### Changed

- `/spec-kitty.specify` and `/spec-kitty.plan` now enforce mandatory discovery interviews, pausing until you answer their question sets before any files are written.
- `/spec-kitty.implement` now enforces the kanban workflow (planned → doing → for_review) with blocking validation, new helper scripts, and a task workflow quick reference.
- Removed the legacy `specify` entrypoint; the CLI is now invoked exclusively via `spec-kitty`.
- Updated installation instructions and scripts to use the new `spec-kitty-cli` package name and command.
- Simplified local template overrides to use the `SPEC_KITTY_TEMPLATE_ROOT` environment variable only.

## [0.0.20] - 2025-10-07

### Changed

- Renamed the primary CLI entrypoint to `spec-kitty` and temporarily exposed a legacy `specify` alias for backwards compatibility.
- Refreshed documentation, scripts, and examples to use the `spec-kitty` command by default.

## [0.0.19] - 2025-10-07

### Changed

- Rebranded the project as Spec Kitty, updating CLI defaults, docs, and scripts while acknowledging the original GitHub Spec Kit lineage.
- Renamed all slash-command prefixes and generated artifact names from `/speckit.*` to `/spec-kitty.*` to match the new branding.

### Added

- Refreshed CLI banner text and tagline to reflect spec-kitty branding.

## [0.0.18] - 2025-10-06

### Added

- Support for using `.` as a shorthand for current directory in `spec-kitty init .` command, equivalent to `--here` flag but more intuitive for users.
- Use the `/spec-kitty.` command prefix to easily discover Spec Kitty-related commands.
- Refactor the prompts and templates to simplify their capabilities and how they are tracked. No more polluting things with tests when they are not needed.
- Ensure that tasks are created per user story (simplifies testing and validation).
- Add support for Visual Studio Code prompt shortcuts and automatic script execution.
- Allow `spec-kitty init` to bootstrap multiple AI assistants in one run (interactive multi-select or comma-separated `--ai` value).
- When running from a local checkout, `spec-kitty init` now copies templates directly instead of downloading release archives, so new commands are immediately available.

### Changed

- All command files now prefixed with `spec-kitty.` (e.g., `spec-kitty.specify.md`, `spec-kitty.plan.md`) for better discoverability and differentiation in IDE/CLI command palettes and file explorers
