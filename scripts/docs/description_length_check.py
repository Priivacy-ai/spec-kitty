"""``description`` metadata gate for the published documentation tree.

Every published page must carry a ``description`` that is **unique**, **not
boilerplate**, and **50-180 characters** long (the SEO band the DocFX build
publishes into ``<meta name=...>`` and the social cards).

This module is the *source-level* gate: it runs at PR time, needs no .NET, and
therefore blocks before merge — which the built-output verifier structurally
cannot do.

Which pages are in scope is **not** this module's decision. It asks
:func:`scripts.docs._published_pages.resolve_published_pages`, which reads
``docs/docfx.json`` — the same declaration the build follows. The gate used to
walk ``docs_root.rglob("*.md")`` itself, and its sibling in
``tests/docs/test_docs_seo.py`` used a hardcoded glob list; the two answers
diverged and the SEO gate spent months guarding 16 of 674 pages while reporting
green. There is now exactly one authority.

``--changed-from BASE_REF`` limits reported violations to changed, published
Markdown pages on PRs while retaining the complete published corpus as the
comparison context for uniqueness. A changed page that duplicates an unchanged
page therefore still fails, but a violation confined to an unchanged page does
not. Without the flag, the whole-tree behavior is unchanged.

A violation is one of:

* ``missing``     — no ``description`` key, or it is blank;
* ``boilerplate`` — the description is a known render-side fallback, i.e. the
  author wrote nothing and inherited the default (distinct from ``missing``
  because the two call for different author actions);
* ``too_short``   — ``len(description) < 50``;
* ``too_long``    — ``len(description) > 180``;
* ``duplicate``   — another published page carries the byte-identical
  description; every such violation names its colliding peers, because a
  one-sided uniqueness report is not actionable.

Output shape::

    { "checked_count": int,
      "violations": [ {"path": str, "reason": str,
                       "length": int | null, "peers": [str]} ] }

Exit codes:

===  =========================================================================
0    No violations, or violations under the default report-only mode.
1    ``--strict`` and at least one violation.
2    The gate could not establish a trustworthy page set (:class:`CoverageError`),
     or ``--changed-from`` could not resolve its Git base. Both are gate
     malfunctions and fail regardless of ``--strict``.
===  =========================================================================

Depends only on the standard library plus ``ruamel.yaml`` (via
:func:`scripts.docs._inventory.parse_frontmatter`). No new dependency.

# Historical note — the retired ``docs/adr/`` exclusion.

# This module used to hold every ADR body out of the gate:
#
#     #: Content-invariant doc subtree excluded from the description gate.
#     _EXCLUDE_PREFIXES: Final[tuple[str, ...]] = ("docs/adr/",)
#
# The stated justification was that ADR bodies are byte-identical to their
# pre-move originals (C-002, "enforced by ``test_adr_content_invariance``") and
# carry only bare ``status`` frontmatter, so by design they have no
# ``description``.
#
# That justification expired. The byte-identity content-invariance proof was a
# transitional gate for the move itself and was retired upstream on 2026-06-29
# (``ccd278061``); ``tests/docs/test_adr_content_invariance.py`` records this in
# its own docstring. The census gate that survived it asserts only a canonical
# ``status`` value and explicitly permits additional frontmatter keys, so
# nothing forbids an ADR from carrying a ``description`` — and the
# ``docs-seo-metadata-enforcement`` mission backfilled one onto all 151 of them.
# The exclusion is therefore gone: ADRs are in scope like every other published
# page, and the exclusions that remain are the enumerated, reasoned ones the
# resolver owns (``_published_pages.DEFAULT_EXCLUSIONS``).
#
# Scope note (DIRECTIVE_024): only the *description* exemption was retired. The
# structural-lint frontmatter contract still exempts ADR bodies through its own
# styleguide config; that exemption is deliberately untouched, because widening
# it would pull 151 files into a different contract's full field requirements.
