# Tool Config Scripts

This directory contains small, tooling-specific glue scripts that improve day-to-day usability without changing core Spec Kitty behavior.

The intent is to keep environment/bootstrap logic modular and reusable across launchers (for example, shared Python virtual environment activation), so user-facing setup stays consistent across shells and platforms.
