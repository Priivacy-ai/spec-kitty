# Tracer: tooling friction — journal-project-consent-3030

## Lane worktrees are allocated from a stale base

`spec-kitty agent action implement` cut lane-c from a commit predating the mission's
own acceptance pins, so the lane reported a clean 0-failure baseline while the
tests that define success were absent from the tree. This is the most dangerous
friction encountered: it manufactures a false green at the exact moment an
implementer establishes trust in their baseline. Worked around by merging the
mission branch into each fresh lane before measuring.

## The `done` gate cannot be satisfied per-WP

`--to done` requires every issue in `issue-matrix.md` to hold a terminal verdict.
In a multi-WP mission that means **no** WP can reach `done` until the mission's
issues are closed, even when the WP itself is complete and merged. Neither
`--force` nor `--done-override-reason` bypasses it. WP01/02/04/05/06/09 are
therefore parked at `approved` despite being finished and merged.

## Dossier edits from a lane branch are rejected

The lane guard refuses `kitty-specs/` writes from implementation branches, so
ownership and DoD edits must be committed on the mission branch. An ownership
commit made in lane-b had to be reverted and re-applied. Compounding this: no WP
in this mission declared any test file in `owned_files`, so every red-first commit
tripped `ACTIVE_WP_SCOPE_VIOLATION` until each WP's ownership was amended — after
finalize, since `spec-kitty tasks` regenerates frontmatter.

## The analysis report goes stale on any spec/tasks edit

`analysis-report.md` hashes its inputs, so remediating a finding invalidates the
report and blocks the next `implement` until it is re-recorded. Correct, but it
means remediation and re-analysis must be batched or the loop repeats.

## Pre-review regression gate times out

The `--to for_review` gate runs scoped tests with a 300s cap and reports
`timed_out`, refusing the transition. The suite this mission touches takes ~2
minutes on its own, so the gate could not complete and was skipped with the
evidence measured manually instead.

## Bulk-edit inference false-positives on "migrate"/"rename"

The mission spec scores 4/4 on bulk-edit heuristics because it discusses a schema
migration, requiring `--acknowledge-not-bulk-edit` on every lane allocation.
