# Specification Quality Checklist: Canonical Status Model Cleanup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Requirement types are separated (Functional / Non-Functional / Constraints)
- [x] IDs are unique across FR-###, NFR-###, and C-### entries
- [x] All requirement rows include a non-empty Status value
- [x] Non-functional requirements include measurable thresholds
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- 17 functional requirements covering finalization bootstrap, frontmatter cleanup, runtime strictness, template cleanup, docs, tests, and migration boundary.
- 4 non-functional requirements with measurable thresholds.
- 6 constraints establishing hard boundaries (preserve history, spec-kitty repo only, keep operational metadata, preserve migration tools, no fallback).
- 7 success criteria verifiable without implementation knowledge.
- 8 user scenarios covering: finalization, hard-fail, generation, agent reads, dashboard, historical fencing, validate-only, migration.
