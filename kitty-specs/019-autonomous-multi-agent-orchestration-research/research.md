## Orchestration Feasibility

### Agents Ready for Autonomous Orchestration

[List agents that meet all criteria: CLI available, task input method, completion detection]

### Agents with Partial Support

[List agents that need workarounds or have limitations]

### Agents Not Suitable

[List agents that cannot participate in headless orchestration]

## Key Findings by Research Question

### RQ-1: CLI Invocation Capabilities

[Consolidated findings about which agents have CLI tools]

### RQ-2: Task Specification Mechanisms

[How each CLI-capable agent accepts instructions]

### RQ-3: Completion Detection

[Exit codes, output formats, success/failure detection]

### RQ-4: Parallel Execution Constraints

[Rate limits, concurrent session support, resource requirements]

### RQ-5: Agent Preference Configuration

[Proposed schema - see data-model.md for full specification]

### RQ-6: Cursor CLI

[Specific findings about Cursor's CLI capabilities]

## Architecture Recommendation

[High-level recommendation for orchestrator design based on findings]

### Recommended Approach

[Description of recommended orchestration pattern]

### Implementation Considerations

[Key technical considerations for future implementation]

## Quality Gate Assessment

| Gate | Requirement | Status |
