# Specification Quality Checklist: Autonomous Multi-Agent Orchestration Research

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Mission**: Research

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Research Specification Completeness

- [x] Research objective clearly stated
- [x] All research questions defined with priority
- [x] Each research question has deliverables
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Scope boundaries (out of scope) defined
- [x] All 12 agents explicitly listed for investigation
- [x] Assumptions documented
- [x] Risks identified

## Requirement Quality

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Research questions are answerable through documentation research
- [x] Success criteria define concrete deliverables
- [x] Quality gates are verifiable
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Research Readiness

- [x] Research questions are specific and bounded
- [x] Deliverables are concrete artifacts (matrices, schemas, documentation)
- [x] Cursor CLI investigation specifically included (per user request)
- [x] Headless/CLI-only scope confirmed (per user clarification)

## Notes

- All items pass validation
- Spec is ready for `/spec-kitty.plan` (research methodology planning)
- Research will require live web searches for current agent documentation
