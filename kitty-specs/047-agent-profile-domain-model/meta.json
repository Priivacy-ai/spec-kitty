  "source_description": "Create a rich Agent Profile model as a first-class entity in spec-kitty 2.x. Agent profiles define WHO an agent IS — not just what model it uses or what role it fills, but its full behavioral identity: purpose, specialization boundaries, collaboration contracts, reasoning modes, directive adherence, and specialization hierarchy (parent-child inheritance). The design source is the doctrine reference repository (doctrine_ref/).",
