# Work Packages: Comprehensive End-User Documentation

**Inputs**: Design documents from `/kitty-specs/014-comprehensive-end-user-documentation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (user stories), research.md (audit findings)

**Tests**: Not applicable - documentation mission.

**Organization**: Fine-grained subtasks (`Txxx`) roll up into work packages (`WPxx`). Each work package must be independently deliverable.

**Prompt Files**: Each work package references a matching prompt file in `/tasks/` generated by `/spec-kitty.tasks`. Lane status is stored in YAML frontmatter (`lane: planned|doing|for_review|done`).

## Subtask Format: `[Txxx] [P?] Description`
- **[P]** indicates the subtask can proceed in parallel (different files/components).
- Include precise file paths.

## Path Conventions
- **Documentation**: `docs/` with Divio subdirectories (`tutorials/`, `how-to/`, `reference/`, `explanation/`)

---

## Work Package WP01: Audit & Directory Setup (Priority: P0)

**Goal**: Audit existing docs, create Divio directory structure, remove outdated content.
**Independent Test**: Directory structure exists, outdated docs removed, audit report complete.
**Prompt**: `tasks/WP01-audit-and-setup.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [x] T001 Audit all existing docs in `docs/` - rate accuracy, classify by Divio type
- [x] T002 Create Divio directory structure (`tutorials/`, `how-to/`, `reference/`, `explanation/`)
- [x] T003 Remove outdated/out-of-scope docs (testing-guidelines.md, local-development.md, etc.)
- [x] T004 Migrate salvageable content to appropriate Divio locations (preserve workspace-per-wp.md, upgrading-to-0-11-0.md)

### Implementation Notes
- Use research.md audit findings as guide
- Preserve: installation.md, workspace-per-wp.md, upgrading-to-0-11-0.md, documentation-mission.md
- Remove: contributor docs, outdated worktree model docs

### Parallel Opportunities
- T002-T004 can proceed in parallel after T001 audit is reviewed

### Dependencies
- None (starting package)

### Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Accidentally delete valuable content → Verify against research.md before deletion

---

## Work Package WP02: Landing Page & Navigation (Priority: P0)

**Goal**: Rewrite index.md as clean landing page with Divio navigation, update toc.yml.
**Independent Test**: index.md renders correctly with clear navigation to all 4 Divio sections.

- [x] T006 Update `docs/toc.yml` for Divio 4-type structure
- [x] T007 Verify DocFX build with new structure

### Implementation Notes
- Landing page should be concise (< 100 lines)
- Clear navigation to: Tutorials, How-To Guides, Reference, Explanations
- Keep dashboard screenshots and logo

### Parallel Opportunities
- None - must complete before content WPs to establish navigation

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP01 (directory structure must exist)

### Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: DocFX compatibility issues → Test build before committing

---

## Work Package WP03: Tutorials (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

- [x] T011 [P] Create `docs/tutorials/multi-agent-workflow.md` - coordinating multiple AI agents on parallel WPs

### Implementation Notes
- Tutorials are learning-oriented, step-by-step
- Must be testable end-to-end
- Include troubleshooting for common errors
- Multi-agent tutorial must show parallel WP execution

### Parallel Opportunities
- All 4 tutorials can be written in parallel (different files)

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP02 (navigation structure)

### Risks & Mitigations

- Include command examples and expected output

### Parallel Opportunities
- All 7 guides can be written in parallel (different files)

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP02 (navigation structure)

  - When parallel is possible vs. sequential required
- Include concrete examples with commands

### Parallel Opportunities
- All 4 guides can be written in parallel

### Dependencies

- supported-agents.md should list all 12 agents with their directories

### Parallel Opportunities
- All 5 references can be written in parallel

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP02 (navigation structure)

### Risks & Mitigations

  - What are git worktrees?
  - Why does spec-kitty use them?
  - How do sparse checkouts work?
  - Branch isolation explained
- Explanations focus on "why" not "how"
- Link to tutorials and how-tos for practical application

### Parallel Opportunities
- All 7 explanations can be written in parallel

### Dependencies
