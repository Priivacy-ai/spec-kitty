"""
Frozen contract: Charter Synthesizer Adapter Seam.

This file is a PLANNING ARTIFACT, not production code. It lives under
kitty-specs/<mission>/contracts/ so reviewers can lock the exact shape of the
seam before WP3.1 implementation begins. Changes to this contract after
WP3.1 lands require an ADR amendment (per KD-6 and DIRECTIVE_003).

Implementation target: src/charter/synthesizer/adapter.py

Key decisions locked here (see plan.md §Key Decisions):
- KD-3: Synchronous Protocol with a mandatory `generate` and an optional
        `generate_batch`. No asyncio in this tranche.
- KD-3 (R): Adapter exposes `id` and `version` as attributes. `AdapterOutput`
        may carry per-call overrides. Orchestration uses override-first with
        adapter-attribute fallback.
- KD-4: The fixture adapter keys fixtures by normalized-request hash. The
        Protocol itself does NOT specify fixture behavior; that is a detail
        of the FixtureAdapter implementation.
