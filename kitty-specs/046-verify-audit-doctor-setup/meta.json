Command taxonomy: verify => mission audit report, doctor setup => environment/setup diagnostics, verify-setup => deprecation alias. Preserve agent status doctor. Add merge-time audit trigger, persist audit metadata, emit canonical lifecycle events, materialize audit artifact under feature artifacts indexed in dossier. Replace NullEmitter in runtime bridge mission-audit path. Add dashboard/local APIs for latest audit summary and artifact. Tests for command migration, alias behavior, merge integration, metadata updates, report format.",
