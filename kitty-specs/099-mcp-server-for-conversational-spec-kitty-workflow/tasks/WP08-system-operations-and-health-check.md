# Work Package Prompt: WP08 – System Operations & Health Check

## Objectives & Success Criteria

**Goal**: Implement system-level MCP tools (health, validation, missions, config).

**Success Criteria**: Health check returns server status, project validation works, missions listed

---

## Context & Constraints

**Prerequisites**:
- Review kitty-specs/099-mcp-server-for-conversational-spec-kitty-workflow/spec.md
- Review kitty-specs/099-mcp-server-for-conversational-spec-kitty-workflow/plan.md
- Review kitty-specs/099-mcp-server-for-conversational-spec-kitty-workflow/data-model.md
- Dependencies completed: WP01, WP02

**Notes**: No external dependencies, uses ProjectContext

## Test Strategy

**Unit Tests**: Tests for all subtasks in tests/mcp/

**Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow tests

**Manual Verification**: Test with MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, or MCP inspector)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: Integration complexity**
- **Mitigation**: Follow adapter pattern from plan.md, reuse existing CLI code

**Risk 2: Error handling gaps**
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive try/except, structured OperationResult errors

---

## Review Guidance

**Key Checkpoints**:
- [ ] All subtasks completed and tested
- [ ] No business logic duplication (uses CLIAdapter)
- [ ] Error messages actionable
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

**Acceptance Criteria**: Success criteria met, all tests passing
