## ⚡ Do This First: Load Agent Profile

Before reading anything else, load your assigned agent profile so your identity,
governance scope, and boundaries are active for this work package:

- Run `/ad-hoc-profile-load python-pedro` (or read `src/doctrine/agent_profiles/built-in/python-pedro.agent.yaml` and adopt it).
- Acknowledge the profile's initialization declaration before proceeding.

## Objective

Produce a **reproducible** audit that enumerates every untrusted-segment→filesystem
sink in `src/specify_cli`, each tagged with exactly one disposition. This is a
WP that adds only audit tooling under `tests/architectural/untrusted_path_audit/`
(no changes to `src/`). Its inventory is the input to WP02, WP03, and WP04.
(IC-02; FR-004, FR-003)

## Context

- Untrusted path segments (`mission_slug`, `feature_slug`, `wp_id`, and anything
  read from `status.events.jsonl` / `meta.json` / frontmatter / CLI args) must
  pass the canonical seam before any FS sink. PR #2036 closed several; the squad
  review found more (e.g. the `meta.json` write-path bypass — see WP02).
- Canonical seam: `assert_safe_path_segment` & `safe_mission_slug` in
  `src/specify_cli/core/paths.py`; `ensure_within_any` in
  `src/specify_cli/core/utils.py`.
- Pre-identified candidates (from the plan; NOT exhaustive): `events/decision_log.py:99`,
  `coordination/surface_resolver.py:433-434`, `missions/_read_path_resolver.py:438`,
  `dossier/drift_detector.py:211,233`, `migration/mission_state.py:1053`,
  `review/cycle.py:225`, `review/arbiter.py:387,483,520`,
  `post_merge/review_artifact_consistency.py:59`, plus the already-known
  `status/store.py`, `status/views.py`, `status/lifecycle.py`.

## Subtasks

### T001 — Define + commit the reproducible audit ruleset
- Write, under `tests/architectural/untrusted_path_audit/`, an audit ruleset that a
  reviewer can re-run. It must record:
  - **Seed-set** of untrusted source symbols/fields (`mission_slug`, `feature_slug`,
    `wp_id`, `snapshot.mission_slug`, `meta.get("mission_slug")`, event-record reads, CLI args).
  - **Sink predicate**: `open`/`read_text`/`read_bytes`/`write_text`/`write_bytes`/
    `mkdir`/`shutil.copy|move|rmtree`/`unlink` and `Path(...) / <segment>` joins.
- Implement as a small committed script (`untrusted_path_audit/audit.py` using `ast`)
  with the ruleset documented in `untrusted_path_audit/RULESET.md`. The script must
  make the count machine-checkable (T004). Keep it dependency-light and ruff/mypy-clean.
  (Use a non-`test_` filename so pytest does not collect it as a test.)
- The matcher MUST follow at least **one hop of local-variable aliasing**: a seed
  segment assigned to a local then joined to a path (`slug = meta.get("mission_slug"); ... root / slug`)
  counts as a sink — not only inline literal `Path(...) / mission_slug` joins.
- `RULESET.md` MUST include a "known false-negative classes" section stating exactly
  what the ruleset does NOT trace (e.g. cross-function flow), so the reviewer judges
  residual risk rather than assuming zero.

### T002 — Run the audit; enumerate every sink
- Execute the ruleset over `src/specify_cli`. Capture every matching call site as a
  row: `file:line | untrusted source | sink op`.
- Include the pre-identified candidates; do not assume the list is complete — let the
  ruleset surface others.

### T003 — Classify each sink with a disposition
- For every row assign exactly one disposition:
  - `routed-through-seam` — already passes `assert_safe_path_segment`/`safe_mission_slug`/`ensure_within_any` (cite the seam call).
  - `unreachable` — the call chain cannot carry an untrusted segment (name the chain/why).
  - `trusted-source` — the segment provably originates from `feature_dir.name` or another derived/trusted value.
- **Named-untrusted rule**: a segment that IS `mission_slug`, `feature_slug`, or `wp_id` (spec Domain Language) may **never** be classified `trusted-source` — it is untrusted by definition. Such a row is either `routed-through-seam` (cite the seam) or `unreachable` (cite the chain). Misclassifying one is an SC-003 failure.
- Rows needing a NEW fix are those currently lacking a seam call but reachable with an untrusted segment → mark `routed-through-seam (TODO)` and route to WP02 (status/) or WP03 (other packages).

### T004 — Emit the audit record with a completeness check
- Write `untrusted_path_audit/inventory.md` (the table). The script MUST assert BOTH:
  1. **Count consistency**: emitted row count == inventory row count (no manually dropped rows); a row with no disposition fails (SC-003).
  2. **Known-candidate presence (anti-undercount tripwire)**: the inventory MUST contain a row for every pre-named candidate — `events/decision_log.py`, `coordination/surface_resolver.py`, `missions/_read_path_resolver.py`, `dossier/drift_detector.py`, `migration/mission_state.py`, `review/cycle.py`, `review/arbiter.py`, `post_merge/review_artifact_consistency.py`, `status/store.py`, `status/views.py`, `status/lifecycle.py`, `aggregate.py:_find_meta_path`, AND a row for the FR-009 `mission_metadata.py` `meta.json` slug source tagged `routed-through-seam (TODO)`. The script self-test FAILS if any is absent. (Defeats a thin/circular audit.)
- **Anti-overfit check**: adding one new untrusted source symbol to the seed-set and re-running MUST surface its sinks — prove the ruleset is general, not hard-coded to the known list.

### T005 — Document aggregate.py + hand off
- Record that `status/aggregate.py._validate_mission_slug` already raises
  `InvalidMissionSlug` (grammar guard), and disposition its composed-path reads
  (`_find_meta_path` glob, etc.) — fix-needed vs trusted (FR-003).
- Produce the **audited-surface inventory** (the list WP04's guard anchors on) as a
  stable artifact (`untrusted_path_audit/audited-surfaces.md`, or a machine-readable
  list the WP04 guard can import).

## Branch Strategy

Planning/base and merge target are both `automation/sonar-security-20260619` (this
mission rides PR #2036; it is flattened — no coordination branch). Execution
worktrees are allocated per computed lane from `lanes.json` at implement time.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Ruleset + script committed under `tests/architectural/untrusted_path_audit/`; re-running reproduces the same inventory.
- [ ] Every sink row carries exactly one disposition with rationale (SC-003); no named untrusted source (`mission_slug`/`feature_slug`/`wp_id`) is `trusted-source`.
- [ ] Emitted count == inventory rows (machine-checked) AND every known candidate + the FR-009 `meta.json` row is present (machine-asserted).
- [ ] aggregate.py raise-guard documented; composed-path reads dispositioned (FR-003).
- [ ] Audited-surface inventory produced for WP04.
- [ ] No `src/` production code modified (audit tooling only).

## Risks / Reviewer guidance

- **Risk**: false positives (trusted `feature_dir.name` mistaken as untrusted) — the
  disposition step must distinguish source provenance, not just pattern-match the sink.
- **Reviewer**: re-run the committed ruleset; confirm the count check; spot-check 3
  dispositions against the code; confirm the `meta.json` write-path bypass (WP02/FR-009)
  appears as a `routed-through-seam (TODO)` row.
