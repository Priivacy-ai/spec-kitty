# Record Architecture Decisions

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2026-01-23

**Deciders:** Spec Kitty Development Team

---

## Context and Problem Statement

As Spec Kitty grows in complexity, we need a systematic way to document significant architectural decisions. Team members (both human and AI agents) need to understand:
- Why certain approaches were chosen
- What alternatives were considered
- What tradeoffs were accepted
- What consequences resulted from decisions

Without structured decision documentation, we face:
- Loss of architectural context over time
- Repeated debates about settled decisions
- Difficulty onboarding new contributors
- Unclear rationale for existing patterns

## Decision Drivers

* Need to preserve architectural knowledge as project evolves
* Multiple AI agents need clear decision context
* Want to avoid "tribal knowledge" that exists only in conversation history
* Need accountability for architectural choices
* Want to learn from both successful and unsuccessful decisions

## Considered Options

* **Option 1:** No formal decision documentation (status quo)
* **Option 2:** Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
* **Option 3:** Design documents in wiki
* **Option 4:** Comprehensive architecture specification document

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** "Option 2: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)", because:
- Lightweight and low-ceremony (fits agile development)
- One decision per document (focused and digestible)
- Immutable once accepted (provides historical record)
- Widely adopted standard with excellent tooling
- Works well with version control (git)
- AI agents can easily read and reference ADRs

### Consequences

#### Positive

* Architectural decisions are documented and discoverable
* New team members can understand decision history
* AI agents have clear context for development work
* Prevents revisiting settled decisions repeatedly
* Creates knowledge base of tradeoffs and lessons learned
* Supports code reviews with architectural validation

#### Negative

* Requires discipline to create ADRs consistently
* Additional documentation overhead
* Risk of ADRs becoming stale if not maintained

#### Neutral

* ADRs are stored in `architecture/adrs/` directory
* Use sequential numbering (0001, 0002, etc.)
* Follow standardized template format

### Confirmation

We'll know this decision is successful if:
- ADRs are consistently created for significant decisions
- Team references ADRs during code reviews and planning
- New contributors find ADRs helpful for understanding codebase
- Decision rationale is clear 6+ months after decisions are made

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: No Formal Decision Documentation

**Pros:**
* No overhead or process burden
* Maximum flexibility

**Cons:**
* Architectural knowledge lost over time
* Decisions must be reverse-engineered from code
* Repeated debates about settled issues
* Difficult onboarding for new contributors

### Option 2: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Pros:**
* Lightweight and focused (one decision per document)
* Immutable historical record
* Widely adopted industry standard
* Works well with version control
* Easy for AI agents to read and reference
* Template-driven for consistency

**Cons:**
* Requires discipline to maintain
* Documentation overhead for each decision
* Can become stale if not kept in sync

### Option 3: Design Documents in Wiki

**Pros:**
* Easy to update and edit
* Can include diagrams and rich media
* Searchable and cross-linked

**Cons:**
* Separate from code repository
* Encourages editing rather than superseding
* No clear versioning or history
* Can become monolithic and hard to navigate

### Option 4: Comprehensive Architecture Specification

**Pros:**
* Single comprehensive reference
* Covers entire system architecture

**Cons:**
* Becomes outdated quickly
* Too large to read or maintain
* Doesn't capture decision history or alternatives
* Difficult to determine when decisions were made
