# Explicit Base Branch Tracking in Work Package Frontmatter

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2026-01-23

**Deciders:** Spec Kitty Development Team

**Technical Story:** Git Repository Management Enhancement - Phase 1

---

## Context and Problem Statement

When implementing work packages in isolated worktrees, agents and users need to know which branch a workspace was created from (the "base branch"). This information is critical for:

- Understanding dependency relationships
- Debugging merge conflicts
- Validating workspace state
- Recreating workspaces if deleted

Previously, base branch information was **computed at runtime** from:

- Git worktree tracking branch metadata
- Dependency relationships in frontmatter
- Git queries (`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{u}`)

This runtime-derived approach created visibility problems:

- Agents couldn't answer "What is my base branch?" without git queries
- No single source of truth for base branch information
- Debugging dependency chains required manual graph traversal
- Base branch invisible in work package metadata

## Decision Drivers

- LLM agents need explicit base branch information without git queries
- Users debugging issues need clear base branch visibility
- Workspace recreation requires knowing original base branch
- Dependency tracking needs audit trail
- Git queries are slow and error-prone for agents
- Need single source of truth for base branch information

## Considered Options

- **Option 1:** Continue runtime derivation (status quo)
- **Option 2:** Store base branch in WP frontmatter
- **Option 3:** Store base branch in git commit message
- **Option 4:** Store base branch in separate metadata file

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** "Option 2: Store base branch in WP frontmatter", because:

- WP frontmatter is already the source of truth for WP metadata
- Visible to agents reading planning artifacts
- Tracked in git history (auditability)
- No new files or infrastructure needed
- Consistent with existing dependency tracking pattern

### Consequences

#### Positive

- Agents can read base branch from frontmatter (no git queries needed)
- Single source of truth for base branch information
- Git history shows when base branch was set/changed
- Enables validation (check if base commit still exists)
- Consistent with existing frontmatter-based metadata pattern
- Simplifies debugging dependency chains

#### Negative

- Frontmatter could diverge from actual git state (if manual branch switching)
- Additional fields in frontmatter (slightly more complex schema)
- Requires updating during workspace creation (minor overhead)

#### Neutral

- Three new frontmatter fields: `base_branch`, `base_commit`, `created_at`
- Fields written automatically during `spec-kitty implement`
- Backward compatible (optional fields)

### Confirmation

We'll validate this decision by:

- Agents successfully querying base branch from frontmatter
- No reports of base branch confusion or debugging issues
- Successful workspace recreation using base branch information
- Positive feedback from users about base branch visibility

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Continue Runtime Derivation

**Pros:**

- No schema changes required
- Minimal implementation effort
- Flexible (no persistent state to manage)

**Cons:**

- Base branch invisible to agents without git queries
- No audit trail for base branch changes
- Debugging requires inferring from git metadata
- Complex logic to derive base branch correctly
- Error-prone (depends on git state being correct)

### Option 2: Store Base Branch in WP Frontmatter

**Pros:**

- Single source of truth
- Visible to agents reading planning artifacts
- Tracked in git history (auditability)
- No new files or infrastructure
- Consistent with existing metadata patterns
- Enables validation and debugging

**Cons:**

- Could diverge from git state
- Additional frontmatter fields
- Minor overhead during workspace creation

### Option 3: Store Base Branch in Git Commit Message

**Pros:**

- Already in git history
- No schema changes needed

**Cons:**

- Difficult to query programmatically
- Not visible in WP files
- Agents would need to parse git log
- Coupling metadata to git commit messages

### Option 4: Store Base Branch in Separate Metadata File

**Pros:**

- Doesn't pollute frontmatter
- Could store additional metadata

**Cons:**

- New file to manage (.kittify/workspace-metadata/ directory)
- Not visible in WP files
- Another file to track and sync
- More complex than using existing frontmatter

## More Information

### Implementation Summary

**Frontmatter fields added:**

- `base_branch` - Branch this WP was created from (e.g., "010-feature-WP01" or "main")
- `base_commit` - Git SHA snapshot at creation (for validation)
- `created_at` - ISO timestamp when workspace was created

**Test coverage:** 17 tests validating frontmatter updates, backward compatibility, orphaned detection
