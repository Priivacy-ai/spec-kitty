# Doctrine Artifact Governance Model

**Filename:** `2026-02-23-1-doctrine-artifact-governance-model.md`

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2026-02-23

**Deciders:** CLI Team, Architecture Team

**Technical Story:** 2.x introduces doctrine-driven governance, constitution compilation, and packaged mission/template assets.

---

## Context and Problem Statement

2.x introduces a doctrine layer that did not previously have an explicit ADR. We now have:

1. Typed doctrine artifacts under `src/doctrine/` (directives, tactics, styleguides, toolguides, schemas, mission assets).
2. A constitution generation flow built from interview answers plus doctrine catalog selection.
3. Runtime/template loading paths that resolve packaged doctrine mission assets as canonical defaults.

Without an ADR, these choices are hard to evaluate and easy to accidentally regress.

## Decision Drivers

1. Make doctrine behavior auditable and deterministic.
2. Keep governance artifacts local-first and repository-native.
3. Enforce schema-level quality gates for doctrine artifacts.
4. Ensure constitution generation references explicit doctrine selections.

## Considered Options

1. Keep doctrine behavior implicit in templates and command handlers.
2. Store doctrine as typed, schema-validated repository artifacts and compile constitution bundles from them (chosen).
3. Move doctrine selection/generation to an external service.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** Store doctrine as typed, schema-validated repository artifacts and compile constitution bundles from them.

### Decision Details

1. Doctrine artifacts are first-class files under `src/doctrine/` with schema contracts in `src/doctrine/schemas/`.
2. Constitution generation compiles interview inputs plus doctrine selections into `.kittify/constitution/` (`constitution.md`, references, library files).
3. Runtime default mission/template assets resolve from doctrine package assets (`src/doctrine/missions/...`) when project and global overrides are absent.
4. Doctrine integrity is tested with fixture schema tests and in-repo artifact compliance tests.

### Consequences

#### Positive

1. Governance behavior is explicit, versioned, and reviewable.
2. Constitution output is reproducible from interview + doctrine selection state.
3. Doctrine changes are testable in CI before user-facing execution.

#### Negative

1. Additional schema and test maintenance burden for doctrine artifacts.
2. More files and concepts for contributors to understand.

#### Neutral

1. Existing command UX is preserved while implementation becomes doctrine-backed.

## Confirmation

This decision is validated when:

1. Doctrine artifacts validate against schemas.
2. Cross-artifact references resolve (for example directive `tactic_refs`, tactic references, toolguide paths).
3. Constitution generation produces deterministic bundles from the same inputs.
4. Runtime/template resolution selects doctrine package defaults when higher-precedence tiers are absent.
