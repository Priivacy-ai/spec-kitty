"""M4 (R3) — delivered glossary packs surface in the JSON ``references[]``.

A pre-merge review found a canonical-source drift: M4's delivery table marks
``GLOSSARY_PACK`` as delivered (slot ``glossary_packs``, activation-gated) and
the bootstrap-TEXT render emits it, but the JSON payload dropped it entirely —
glossary was not folded into ``build_disclosure_payload``'s ``extra_delivered``,
so a delivered glossary pack was silently absent from the action-scoped JSON.

The minimal, consistent fix (mirroring the deliberate ``asset`` asymmetry,
#3037) folds delivered glossary packs into the flat ``references[]`` link set via
``extra_delivered={"glossary_pack": bundle.glossary_pack_ids}`` — WITHOUT a typed
``glossary``/``glossary_packs`` array and WITHOUT a ``context_schema_version``
bump (``references`` is already a declared top-level key).

This module pins that contract two ways:

* directly over ``progressive_disclosure.build_disclosure_payload`` with a
  synthetic DRG carrying a ``glossary_pack:<id>`` node — the glossary id must
  appear in ``references[]`` (deterministic, no live doctrine required);
* over the live ``build_charter_context_json`` payload — a delivered glossary
  pack must NOT introduce a typed ``glossary``/``glossary_packs``/``assets``
  array, and ``context_schema_version`` must stay pinned at ``1.1.0``.

Red-first: on the base (glossary absent from ``extra_delivered``) the first
assertion — the glossary id in ``references[]`` — fails.
