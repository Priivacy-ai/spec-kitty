"""Mandatory parity test: ``is_spdd_reasons_active`` vs. ``PackContext.from_config``.

Mission ``spdd-reasons-activation-split-brain-01M1K6VN``, WP01. This is the
mission's **load-bearing artifact** (spec.md Constraint C-003 / Decision
Record 1): ``activation.py`` cannot import
``charter.activation.pack_context.PackContext`` directly (C-004 forbids
``charter.offering -> charter.activation`` in any form), so the rewritten
``is_spdd_reasons_active`` carries its own raw, independent replication of
``PackContext.from_config``'s INV-2 two-file pointer resolution. Nothing but
this test proves the two independent readers stay in agreement -- without
it, the two implementations can silently drift apart again, reproducing the
exact defect class this mission exists to close.

Also carries T001's FR-004 absent-``.kittify/config.yaml`` pin (both the
``is_spdd_reasons_active`` helper in isolation and the real
``apply_spdd_blocks_for_project`` entry point FR-004's own falsifiable
Acceptance Criterion names).

Every fixture in T002's matrix, both same-process mutation cases (step 4 and
step 4a), and the step-6 non-list fixture are RED against the pre-fix
``activation.py`` body and GREEN after T004's rewrite -- see this WP's final
report for the captured RED-run output (C-011).
