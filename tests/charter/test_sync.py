"""Tests for the (retired-extraction) charter sync orchestrator.

consolidate-charter-bundle (IC-04 / WP04, T028c): ``sync()``'s prose->triad
scrape -- parsing ``charter.md`` and writing ``governance.yaml`` /
``directives.yaml`` / ``metadata.yaml`` -- is RETIRED. ``governance``/
``directives`` are hand-authored sections directly inside the git-tracked
``charter.yaml`` now (``charter.sync.load_governance_config`` /
``load_directives_config``). ``sync()`` is RETAINED only for its callers'
contract (canonical-root resolution via ``ensure_charter_bundle_fresh``, the
``charter sync`` CLI command): it still performs the ``charter.md``
staleness check (comparing against a pre-existing ``metadata.yaml``'s
``charter_hash``, when one happens to be present) and reports
``stale_before`` accurately, but ``synced`` is now ALWAYS ``False`` and
``files_written`` ALWAYS ``[]`` -- there is nothing left for this function
to produce.
