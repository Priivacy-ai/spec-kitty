"""Hardening tests for the canonical generated-file writer (#3651 follow-up).

An adversarial review of ``write_generated_file`` found three latent-safety
gaps that ``tests/upgrade/test_generated_writer.py`` did not cover:

- NOTE 1: the original write was not atomic — ``write_text`` truncates
  the target in place, and the read-only strip afterwards was a bare
  statement with no ``finally``. An interrupted or failing write could
  leave a previously-good file both truncated and writable.
- NOTE 2: ``Path.chmod`` follows symlinks, so a symlinked target would
  silently mutate the link's destination outside the managed tree.
- MINOR 2: the module docstring overclaimed which callers route through
  this writer.

This file covers the *behavioral* consequences of the fix for the first
two (the docstring fix has no runtime behavior to assert). Covers:

- (a) a failing/interrupted write leaves a pre-existing target's content
  and read-only bit untouched.
- (b) a symlink target is refused rather than silently written through.
- (c) the pre-existing round-trip contract (absent target, already
  read-only target, ``read_only=False``) still holds after the rewrite.
