"""Tests for the canonical generated-file writer (FR-001/002, #3651).

Covers:
- T007: ``write_generated_file`` unit tests — the read-only permission
  lifecycle it owns (restore-before-write, strip-after-write, propagate
  genuine failures, idempotency).
- T004: a mechanical architectural guard so an in-scope generated-command/
  skill migration cannot reintroduce a bare ``write_text`` on a read-only-
  destined path without the guard catching it (prose audits alone silently
  regress).

T004 guard strategy — chosen approach and why:

A fully general AST/data-flow scan that proves *which* ``Path`` a given
``.write_text(...)`` call targets (to decide "is this a read-only-destined
generated command/skill surface?") requires tracing variable assignments
across branches and helper calls — fragile and easy to get subtly wrong in
a text-based guard. Instead this file uses the two-part strategy the FR-002
research explicitly allows as a fallback:

1. **Known in-scope list** (``_IN_SCOPE_GENERATED_SURFACE_MIGRATIONS``):
   every migration confirmed (by manual research + the #3679 adversarial
   review that found the 5 missed sites) to write a generated agent
   command/skill file. Each must contain zero bare ``.write_text(`` calls
   and must use ``write_generated_file``.
2. **Full-scan anti-pattern net** (``test_no_unrouted_bare_write_text_on_agent_surface_paths``):
   every migration file under ``_MIGRATIONS_DIR`` — not just the known
   list — is scanned for the *combination* of (a) a bare ``.write_text(``
   call and (b) any reference to the agent-command/skill-directory helpers
   (``get_agent_dirs_for_project``, ``AGENT_DIRS``, or a literal
   ``.agents`` + ``skills`` path-segment pair). This heuristic is
   deliberately broad (recall over precision — a docstring mention is
   enough to flag a file): a false positive only costs an explicit,
   rationale-carrying entry in ``_EXEMPT_AGENT_DIR_REFERENCING_WRITERS``,
   never a silent miss. This is the part of the guard that catches a
   *future* migration nobody enumerated yet — "cannot be forgotten again"
   for the whole class, not just the 21 files known today.

The exemption set requires a one-line rationale per entry (never bare
omission) and the test asserts *exact* set equality against what the scan
currently finds, so a stale exemption (the file changed and no longer
matches) fails loudly too.
