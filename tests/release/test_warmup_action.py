"""Contract tests for the shared warmup / test-env-creation composite action.

FR-003/#3283 (mission ci-pipeline-reinstatement-01M1X35E, WP04): a shared
composite pre-builds the editable test environment exactly once and
publishes it as a cache-keyed reusable artefact so downstream shards reuse it
instead of re-running the install — dissolving the venv-lock bootstrap
cascade. PR mode resolves a **pinned** `spec_kitty_events` rev (deterministic,
cache-hit, charter pinned-rev policy); nightly/full mode resolves the
**latest** mainline (upstream-drift signal) — see research.md D2 and
data-model.md E8.

The YAML is loaded lazily inside each test (never at import time) so this
module always collects, even on base where
``.github/actions/warmup/action.yml`` does not yet exist — the T018 red-first
state fails for the right reason (missing file), not a collection error.
