"""Shared mission fixtures for the ``spec-kitty review`` CLI test split.

``test_review.py`` (``fast``) and ``test_review_git_baseline.py``
(``integration`` + ``git_repo``) are two halves of one subject. They were split
so the ``fast`` lane keeps its no-subprocess contract — see
``tests/architectural/test_pytest_marker_correctness.py`` Rule 2 and
``docs/context/testing-taxonomy.md`` under "Fast". The fixture builders both
halves need live here rather than being duplicated (and allowed to drift)
across the two modules.

:func:`setup_fixture` is deliberately **pure**: it writes ``meta.json`` and
status events and nothing else. The real ``git`` repository construction that
earns a genuine dead-code diff baseline lives only in the ``git_repo``-marked
module, so a future test added to the ``fast`` half cannot silently acquire a
process spawn by passing a baseline.
