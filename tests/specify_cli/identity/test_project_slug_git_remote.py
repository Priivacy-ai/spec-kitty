"""``derive_project_slug`` against real git remotes (spec-kitty#113 triage).

Deliberately not mocked: the thing under test is the interaction with git's
own URL-resolution behavior, so a mock would encode the very assumption
being verified.

spec-kitty#113 asked whether ``derive_project_slug`` needed the same
raw-config-over-transport-view fix #111 gave
``zeitgeist_client/repo_identity.py`` (both read a git remote URL on a
machine that may carry a global ``url.<base>.insteadOf`` rewrite, e.g.
every exe.dev VM). Triage conclusion: no. #111's site consumes the URL's
*host* for forge-admission; this function only ever consumes the trailing
path segment via ``url.split("/")[-1]``, and ``insteadOf`` is a pure prefix
substitution — it rewrites the host but can never touch what follows the
matched prefix. ``test_slug_unaffected_by_a_global_insteadof_transport_rewrite``
below pins that invariant so a future refactor of the URL parsing can't
silently reintroduce a host dependency.
