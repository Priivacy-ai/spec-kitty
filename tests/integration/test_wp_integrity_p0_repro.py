"""SC-001 P0 reproduction for #3371: PRIMARY ``lanes.json`` must never land on coord.

write-path-integrity WP02 / T007 (FR-001 / FR-004 / SC-001). This is the
NON-VACUOUS red-first acceptance test for the mission's P0. It composes the
**real** production path -- ``_ensure_planning_artifacts_committed_git`` (the
implement-time planning auto-commit) followed by the real ``allocate_lane_worktree``
lane allocator -- on a coordination-topology, PR-bound (``--start-branch``)
mission, and proves that a PRIMARY-partition ``lanes.json`` is routed to the
mission's primary target branch, never the coordination branch.

Why this is genuinely RED against the pre-fix tree (the mechanism):

* The mission is coordination-topology, so ``_resolve_placement_ref`` threads a
  ``placement_ref`` whose ``.ref`` is the **coordination branch**. Pre-fix, the
  ``placement_ref is not None`` arm of ``_commit_planning_artifacts_transaction``
  committed the WHOLE batch VERBATIM to that coord ref, so the PRIMARY
  ``lanes.json`` landed on the coordination branch (empirically observed:
  ``git ls-tree -r <coord_ref>`` contains ``lanes.json`` -- non-vacuity leg (a)).
* ``lanes.json``'s recorded ``planning_commit_sha`` points at a commit on the
  primary **target** branch that ALSO carries ``lanes.json`` with DIFFERENT
  content (non-vacuity leg (b): the merge genuinely has a real ``lanes.json`` on
  both sides). ``allocate_lane_worktree`` branches the lane off the coordination
  branch (which now carries the mis-routed ``lanes.json``) and merges the
  recorded ``planning_commit_sha`` on top -- an ``add/add`` conflict on
  ``lanes.json`` (both sides add it, no common-ancestor version), which
  ``_merge_recorded_planning_commit`` fails closed with the specific
  ``PlanningCommitMergeConflictError``.

Why ``--start-branch`` / PR-bound is LOAD-BEARING (documented per T007):

1. The recorded planning tip (a commit on the non-protected PR target branch that
   carries ``lanes.json``) and the coordination base (minted BEFORE planning
   exists) genuinely diverge, so the lane-allocation merge is a real ``add/add``
   rather than a fast-forward.
2. The FIX commits the PRIMARY group to the mission's target branch. If that
   target were the default protected ``main``, ``BookkeepingTransaction`` /
   ``safe_commit`` would REFUSE the primary commit and the test could never go
   GREEN. A real ``--start-branch`` mission targets a non-protected feature
   branch, which is exactly what lets the fixed PRIMARY commit succeed.

Post-fix, ``lanes.json`` (PRIMARY) is committed to the target branch and the
coord ref never carries it, so the lane allocation is a clean merge -- GREEN.
