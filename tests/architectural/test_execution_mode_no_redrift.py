"""Re-drift guard for the M7 ExecutionMode consolidation.

Mission ``rc3-execution-mode-consolidation-01M0GGX1`` retired the dead
``mission_runtime.context.ExecutionMode`` enum and renamed the live ownership
enum ``ExecutionMode`` -> ``WorkProductKind``. The residual footgun was a class
named ``ExecutionMode`` living in-repo (colliding, by name, with the external
``spec_kitty_events.status.ExecutionMode``) and a local enum pairing a
``worktree`` member with a ``code_change`` member (the mis-named duplicate of the
external worktree-vs-direct axis whose ``code_change`` token also clashed with the
ownership enum's unrelated ``code_change`` = "WP produces code").

This guard fails if either footgun returns. It asserts *absence of the footgun*,
NOT the exact member set of ``WorkProductKind`` — so it deliberately PERMITS a
later mission (M6 / #3590) adding a non-diff completion-mode member to
``WorkProductKind`` (AC-5). The external ``spec_kitty_events`` enum lives outside
``src/`` and is intentionally out of scope.
