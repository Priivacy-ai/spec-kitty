"""The three SC-015 decoys, alongside one live seam that must still be counted.

Control fixture for ``scripts/patch_seam_census.py`` (WP03 / SC-015). Not named
``test_*``, so pytest never collects it.

**Decoy 1 — this docstring.** The two constructs below are prose, not code. An
AST census (NFR-007) contributes nothing for either; a text-matching census
counts both::

    mock_sleep.assert_called_once_with(9.9)
    @patch("specify_cli.tracker.saas_client.time.sleep")

That quoted target is a real, resolvable one on purpose: ``check_patch_targets.py``
extracts with a **regex over raw source**, so it sees this docstring. A dangling
target here would print ``::error::Broken patch() targets`` and exit 1 in an
``[ENFORCED]`` CI job.

This is also the exact hazard that made three of the mission's artifacts
disagree: ``test_saas_client.py:559`` carries the pre-fix target inside a
docstring, so a grep-based arm would demand a *prose edit* to satisfy a numeric
gate.

Decoys 2 (a comment) and 3 (a bare string literal) live in the module body.
