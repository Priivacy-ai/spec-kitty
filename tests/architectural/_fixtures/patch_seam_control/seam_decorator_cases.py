"""Decorator-form patch seams with corruptible read-side assertions.

Control fixture for ``scripts/patch_seam_census.py`` (mission
``sync-sleep-count-3136-01KZ9B5A``, WP03 / SC-015).

This module is deliberately **not** named ``test_*``: pytest's default
``python_files`` is ``test_*.py``/``*_test.py``, so nothing here is ever
collected, executed, or counted by the arch-shard coverage baseline. It exists
only to be *read* by the census's AST walker.

Every ``patch()`` target below resolves on this tree — ``check_patch_targets.py``
rglobs every ``*.py`` under ``tests/`` with a **regex over raw source**, so an
unresolvable literal here (even one quoted in a docstring) would red an
``[ENFORCED]`` CI job.
