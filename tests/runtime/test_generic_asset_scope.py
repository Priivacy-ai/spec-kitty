"""WP04 (#4017): generic-scope VERIFICATION for the "Generic -- all owners" ruling.

WP03 already landed the SOURCE fix (re-assess-under-lock + torn-read retry +
destination role-tagging) generically across every global asset owner --
``bootstrap.ensure_runtime`` (the runtime owner), and
``agent_commands.ensure_global_agent_commands`` /
``agent_skills.ensure_global_agent_skills`` (the two NON-runtime owners) --
and drove both quarantined e2e tests green. This module does not change any
production code (``owned_files`` is this file only); it independently proves
two remaining claims from the mission spec's FR-004/SC-006:

- T012: the SAME deterministic loser/winner interleave that
  ``tests/runtime/test_ensure_runtime_concurrency.py`` uses to prove
  ``ensure_runtime()`` (the RUNTIME owner) converges also converges for a
  genuine NON-runtime owner -- ``agent_skills.ensure_global_agent_skills()``
  and ``agent_commands.ensure_global_agent_commands()`` -- via their own
  re-assess-under-lock mirrors (``agent_skills.py:286-308``,
  ``agent_commands.py:377-399``). It also determines, empirically rather than
  by assumption, whether "the merge.py:94 recheck nesting" is reachable from
  the ``global_assets`` BATCH path at all (it is not -- see
  ``TestMergePyNestingReachabilityFromTheBatch`` below for the mechanism and
  why the existing ``test_ensure_runtime_concurrency.py`` coverage is the
  correct home for that nesting instead).
- T013: whether ``managed_skills.py``'s SEPARATE
  ``_recheck_command_completion`` (line 165, added by #4082's
  ``recheck_applied()`` idempotency) is *also* race-safe against a genuine
  concurrent peer, or whether it is a distinct, uncovered race surface. It is
  the latter -- driven and confirmed below, with the concrete root cause
  recorded rather than silently assumed away (FR-004's explicit instruction).

    """T013 (FR-004): ``managed_skills.py``'s ``_recheck_command_completion``
    (line 165) is explicitly called out in the spec as a SEPARATE recheck
    from ``asset_preparation.check_assets`` -- it never calls it, and #4082
    gave it its own ``recheck_applied()`` idempotency for the provisioning
    YAML write specifically. WP03's re-assess-under-lock fix never touched
    this function or its caller (``ManagedSkillsProvider.apply_composition``,
    which dispatches to the project-skill-installer surface, not to any of
    the three ``ensure_*`` global owners WP03 fixed).

    VERDICT (recorded here rather than assumed): it still races against a
    genuine concurrent peer, for a DIFFERENT and more fundamental reason than
    the #4017 stale-observation race WP02/WP03 fixed. The command-skills
    manifest (``.kittify/command-skills-manifest.json``) that
    ``command_installer`` builds embeds a wall-clock ``installed_at``
    timestamp per entry, so two independently-computed "canonical" batches
    for the exact same cold project NEVER produce byte-identical manifest
    content -- there is no role-tagged/canonical-content tolerance (WP02's
    fix) that could converge this, because the two sides' "canonical" bytes
    genuinely differ by design, not merely by a transient stale read. The
    test below drives this empirically (real installer, real filesystem, two
    independently-built compositions against the same cold project) and pins
    the CURRENT behavior -- a raised ``ValueError`` -- as a confirmed,
    scoped-out-of-WP04 finding, not a silent assumption of safety.

    Scoped follow-up recorded for the operator: `_recheck_command_completion`
    (and/or the manifest writer feeding it) needs either (a) an
    ``installed_at``-tolerant content comparison analogous to WP02's
    ``_content_equal``, or (b) its own re-assess-under-lock mirror, before
    the concurrent-installer race this WP intentionally scoped as "generic
    -- all owners" can be called closed for the managed-skills composition
    path specifically. This is out of WP04's ``tests/runtime/`` scope
    (owned_files is this test file only; the fix belongs to
    ``src/specify_cli/tool_surface/providers/managed_skills.py`` and/or
    ``src/specify_cli/skills/command_installer.py``, neither of which WP04
