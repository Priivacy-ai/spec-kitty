      - name: Doctrine Domain
        definition: The domain model that structures reusable governance knowledge in Spec Kitty. It
          organizes behavior and constraints into composable artifacts (paradigms, directives, 
          tactics, templates, styleguides, and toolguides).

            Governance
      - name: Guideline
        definition: A high-level doctrine rule expressing non-negotiable or strongly preferred 
          governance behavior. Guidelines sit at the highest precedence and bound what project-level
          constitution may customize.

      - name: Paradigm
        definition: A worldview-level framing for how work is approached in a domain. Paradigms 
          influence selection and interpretation of directives and tactics but are not executable 
          step recipes themselves.

      - name: Directive
        definition: A constraint-oriented governance rule that applies across flows or phases. 
          Directives encode required or advisory expectations and can reference lower-level tactics 
          for execution.

      - name: Tactic
        definition: A reusable behavioral execution pattern that defines how work is performed. 
          Tactics are operational and agent-consumable, and can be selected by directives and 
          mission context.

      - name: Template Set
        definition: A structured set of doctrine templates that shape output artifacts and 
          interaction contracts for workflows. Template sets allow consistent behavior across 
          missions while remaining configurable through constitution selections.

      - name: Styleguide
        definition: A doctrine artifact defining cross-cutting quality and consistency conventions 
          (for example coding, documentation, or testing style) that apply across missions and 
          templates.

      - name: Toolguide
        definition: A doctrine artifact defining tool-specific operational guidance, syntax, and 
          constraints (for example PowerShell usage conventions) used by agents and contributors 
          during execution.

      - name: Schema (Doctrine Artifact)
        definition: A machine-validated contract that defines allowed structure and fields for 
          doctrine artifacts. Used in CI/tests to fail fast when invalid doctrine files are 
          introduced.

      - name: Import Candidate
        definition: A pull-based curation record for an external doctrine idea. Captures source 
          provenance, target classification, adaptation notes, and adoption status before 
          canonization.

      - name: Constitution Selection
        definition: The project-level selection layer that activates and narrows doctrine assets 
          (for example selected paradigms, directives, agent profiles, available tools, and template
          set) without changing doctrine source artifacts.
