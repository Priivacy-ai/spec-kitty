      - name: Vision
        definition: A project-level intent document capturing the repository's purpose, desired 
          outcomes, scope boundaries, and stakeholder overview. Created during Bootstrap as the 
          first interactive step. Provides persistent context for all subsequent 
          `/spec-kitty.specify` discovery interviews — agents reference it to align feature 
          proposals with project intent. Deliberately purpose-first (not problem-first) to 
          accommodate non-solution repositories (creative writing, exploration, research).

          Related terms: Bootstrap, Constitution, Feature
          Distinction: Vision captures *what/why* (project intent). Constitution captures *how* 
            (technical standards and governance). Different lifecycles, different audiences.
      - name: Bootstrap
        definition: The interactive onboarding command (`/spec-kitty.bootstrap`) proposed in 
          architecture journeys to capture project-level intent and governance in a guided flow. It 
          complements the current standalone `/spec-kitty.constitution` command. Intended outputs 
          are `vision.md` (purpose, outcomes, scope) and `constitution.md` (technical standards, 
          quality gates, governance), with optional paradigm customization for specialist agent 
          profiles.

          Phases: 1. Vision (required) → 2. Agent Customization (recommended) → 3. Technical 
            Standards → 4. Code Quality (optional) → 5. Tribal Knowledge (optional) → 6. Governance

      - name: '`.kittify/`'
        definition: Spec Kitty's project-local configuration directory. Contains `config.yaml` 
          (current source of truth for configured tool/agent routing), `merge-state.json` (merge 
          progress), and `memory/constitution.md`. Distinct from `doctrine/` — `.kittify/` is 
          SK-specific; `doctrine/` is the governance framework.

      - name: '`kitty-specs/`'
        definition: Directory where all feature specifications, plans, tasks, and work package files
          are stored. Follows naming pattern `<number>-<slug>/`. All planning artifacts are 
          committed to the main branch here before implementation begins.

      - name: VCS Lock
        definition: The feature-level rule that VCS backend selection is persisted in `meta.json` at
          creation time and remains fixed for that feature's lifecycle to keep WP execution 
          consistent.

      - name: '`doctrine/`'
        definition: Directory (usually at project root) where Doctrine Stack artifacts live, 
          distributed as a git subtree. Its root-level placement signals cross-cutting authority. 
          Contains guidelines, directives, paradigms (or legacy approaches during migration), 
          tactics, templates, and agent profiles.
