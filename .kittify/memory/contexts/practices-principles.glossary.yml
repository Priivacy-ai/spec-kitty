    terms:
      - name: Human In Charge
        definition: The foundational governance principle that humans retain authority over all 
          critical decisions. Agents may operate autonomously within defined decision boundaries but
          must escalate architectural changes, breaking changes, security modifications, and 
          ambiguous requirements. The `work/human-in-charge/` directory structure provides 
          escalation channels (decision requests, blockers, problem reports).

      - name: Human Review Loop
        definition: A checkpoint in the workflow where a human reviews agent-produced work before it
          advances. In Spec Kitty, the `for_review` lane and `/spec-kitty.review` command embody 
          this pattern. Ensures quality gates remain under human authority.

      - name: Escalation
        definition: The act of an agent pausing autonomous work and requesting human guidance. 
          Triggered by blockers, critical decisions, ambiguous requirements, or unexpected results. 
          Escalation artifacts are placed in `work/human-in-charge/` subdirectories.

      - name: Decision Boundary
        definition: 'The classification of decisions into minor (agent-autonomous) and critical (requires
          human approval). Minor: file naming, code style, test data, documentation phrasing. Critical:
          architectural changes, breaking APIs, schema modifications, dependency changes, security policy
          changes.'

      - name: Collaboration Contract
        definition: The behavioral commitments defined in an agent profile — what the agent will do,
          how it will communicate, when it will escalate, and what quality standards it upholds. 
          Each Doctrine agent profile (`doctrine/agents/*.agent.md`) embodies a collaboration 
          contract.

      - name: Phase Authority
        definition: The designation of who owns each phase of the Spec-Driven Development lifecycle.
          Different phases may have different authority levels — e.g., specification is human-owned,
          implementation may be agent-delegated, review requires human sign-off.

      - name: Phase Checkpoint Protocol
        definition: End-of-phase verification ensuring deliverables meet quality gates before 
          proceeding. Each SDD phase has defined exit criteria. Checkpoints may be automated (tests 
          pass, lint clean) or human-gated (review approval).

      - name: Pre-flight Validation
        definition: Automatic validation checks run before high-impact workflow actions (especially 
          merge) to catch blocking conditions early.

      - name: Conflict Forecasting
        definition: Predictive merge-time analysis that estimates likely conflicts before executing 
          an actual merge.

        definition: Persisted merge-progress state used to support interrupted merge recovery via 
          resume/abort workflows.

      - name: Interrupted Merge Recovery
        definition: The operational protocol for recovering from interrupted merges, typically using
          `--resume` to continue or `--abort` to reset and start clean.

      - name: Living Glossary
        definition: A glossary that evolves with the codebase — terms are added, refined, or 
          deprecated as the domain understanding deepens. This very document is a living glossary. 
          Terminology decisions are treated as architectural decisions.

      - name: Living Specification
        definition: A specification that evolves during discovery and planning phases, then freezes 
          at implementation start. In Spec Kitty, `spec.md` is living during `/spec-kitty.specify` 
          and `/spec-kitty.clarify`, then becomes the frozen contract that `plan.md` and `tasks.md` 
          implement against.

      - name: Stopping Condition
        definition: 'A predefined criterion that tells an agent when to halt pursuit of a goal. Prevents
          unbounded iteration. Examples: test suite passes, lint clean, reviewer approves, maximum retry
          count reached, or an escalation condition is triggered.'

      - name: File-Based Orchestration
        definition: The coordination pattern where workflow state is stored in files (YAML 
          frontmatter, markdown, JSON) rather than a database or API. Spec Kitty uses file-based 
          orchestration — lane status lives in WP frontmatter, config in `.kittify/config.yaml`, 
          events in JSONL files. Enables git-native versioning and multi-agent coordination without 
          shared infrastructure.

      - name: AFK Mode
        definition: 'Away From Keyboard — a session management protocol granting agents extended autonomy
          with defined boundaries. When activated: commit after each logical unit, push permission granted,
          minor decisions autonomous, critical decisions trigger escalation. Deactivated when human returns
          or agent encounters a critical decision.'
