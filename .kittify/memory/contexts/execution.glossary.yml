    terms:
      - name: Tool
        definition: The CLI application that executes LLM prompts on behalf of the orchestrator. A 
          tool wraps a model provider and exposes it as a command-line interface.

          Status: candidate
          In code: Canonical naming migration in progress. Runtime still includes legacy `agent` 
            identifiers in several surfaces.
          Related terms: Agent, Orchestration Assignment
          Decision history: '2026-02-15: Canonical term renamed from "agent" to "tool" to resolve collision
            with Doctrine agent profiles. See `glossary/naming-decision-tool-vs-agent.md`.'
          Fields: 'tool_id: Unique identifier (e.g., `"claude"`, `"opencode"`, `"codex"`); command: CLI
            executable name; uses_stdin: Whether the tool reads prompts from stdin'
      - name: Tool Invoker
        definition: 'The Protocol (interface) that defines how a tool is invoked: check installation,
          build command, parse output.'
        aliases:
          - '`AgentInvoker`'

          Status: candidate
          In code: 'Planned canonical interface; current code still uses legacy invoker naming in parts
            of the runtime. See: `ToolInvoker` (Protocol, runtime_checkable)'
          Related terms: Tool
      - name: Invocation Result
        definition: Structured output of a tool execution — captures success status, stdout/stderr, 
          duration, files modified, commits made, errors, and warnings.

          In code: 'Target runtime contract; implementation details are still being consolidated during
            mission/runtime convergence. See: `InvocationResult` (dataclass)'
