      - name: Doctrine (Agentic Doctrine)
        definition: Spec Kitty's governance framework that defines reusable behavioral assets and 
          rules. Domain terms for doctrine artifacts are canonicalized in the Doctrine glossary 
          context.

      - name: Constitution
        definition: A project-level governance document that narrows or extends Doctrine rules for a
          specific repository. It is the execution-time selector layer for active paradigms, 
          directives, template sets, selected agent profiles, and available tools. Human-readable 
          markdown created via `/spec-kitty.constitution` in current implementation. May narrow 
          directive thresholds but must not contradict Guidelines.

          In code: Constitution command templates; parser and enforcement are evolving under Feature
            044
          Related terms: Precedence Hierarchy, Doctrine, Constitution Selection
          Precedence position: 3 (after General and Operational Guidelines; before Directives)
      - name: Precedence Hierarchy
        definition: The conflict resolution order when governance rules disagree. Higher-precedence 
          rules override lower ones. This is the governing rule for resolving conceptual conflicts 
          in governance terms.
        meta:
          Context: Governance
          Status: canonical
          In code: Defined in Feature 044 governance spec; implementation is in progress
          Related terms: Constitution, Doctrine, Guideline, Directive, Paradigm, Tactic
          Operational rule: When sources disagree, apply this hierarchy first; use newer accepted 
            ADRs over older ADRs; then align with current implementation behavior
      - name: Governance Plugin
        definition: An ABC that validates workflow state at lifecycle boundaries. Returns a 
          `ValidationResult` (pass/warn/block) with reasons, directive references, and suggested 
          actions. The `NullGovernancePlugin` is the default no-op implementation.

      - name: Validation Result
        definition: Structured output of a governance check. Contains status (pass/warn/block), 
          reasons, directive references, and suggested actions.

            (list[str])'
      - name: Governance Context
        definition: The context object passed to governance hooks. Provides the plugin with enough 
          information to make a validation decision without direct file access.

      - name: Two-Masters Problem
        definition: 'The conflict that arises when both Guidelines and the Constitution claim top-level
          behavioral authority over agents. Resolved by the Precedence Hierarchy: Constitution sits at
          position 3 — it customizes within Guideline bounds, not above them.'

      - name: ADR (Architectural Decision Record)
        definition: An immutable record of a single architecturally significant decision, including 
          context, alternatives considered, decision outcome, and consequences. Accepted ADRs are 
          not edited; changes are captured by superseding ADRs.
