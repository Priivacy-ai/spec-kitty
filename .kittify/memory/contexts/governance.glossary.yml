      - name: Doctrine (Agentic Doctrine)
        definition: Spec Kitty's behavioral governance framework — a stack of Guidelines → Paradigms
          → Directives → Tactics → Templates providing policy enforcement, decision traceability, 
          agent profiles, and precedence-driven constraint systems. Distributed as a git subtree at 
          `doctrine/`.

      - name: Guideline
        definition: 'A high-level, immutable governance rule from the governance stack. Two levels: **general**
          (highest precedence, non-negotiable framework values) and **operational** (day-to-day behavioral
          norms). No project-level override may contradict them.'

      - name: Directive
        definition: A numbered, cross-cutting behavioral constraint from the governance stack. 
          Directives have phase tags (indicating when they apply), severity (advisory/required), and
          structured rules. They can be narrowed by the Constitution but not removed.
        examples:
          - Directive 017 (TDD Required)
          - Directive 023 (Conventional Commits)
          - Directive 034 (Spec-Driven Development)

          Related terms: Guideline, Precedence Hierarchy, Agent Profile
      - name: Paradigm
        definition: 'A set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a shared way
          of viewing and framing work in a domain. Paradigms define *how to see and think* about a problem
          space — distinct from step-by-step Tactics. Paradigms are **user-selectable**: during Bootstrap,
          users choose paradigms that guide specialist agents (for example: spec-driven development, locality
          of change, decision-first development). Selected paradigms are stored as project-level preferences
          in the Constitution and shape behavior across features.'

        examples:
          - TDD (Test-Driven Development)

          Related terms: Tactic, Mission, Constitution, Bootstrap
          Distinction: Users select paradigms during bootstrap. Agents execute tactics selected by 
            directives and mission context.
      - name: Tactic
        definition: 'A step-by-step execution pattern within the governance stack — concrete procedures
          for performing specific activities. Together with Templates, they form the lowest precedence
          governance layer. Tactics are **agent-facing**: agents pull in the specific tactic files they
          need during execution. Users do not select tactics directly — they select Paradigms, while directives
          and mission context determine which tactics apply at execution time.'

          Status: canonical
          Location: '`doctrine/tactics/*.tactic.md`'
          Related terms: Paradigm, Template (Doctrine), Slash Command
          Distinction: Paradigms define *how to think/see* (user-selectable). Tactics define *how to
            execute* (agent-consumed).
      - name: Template (Doctrine)
        definition: An output contract and artifact scaffold within the governance stack — the 
          structured format that Tactics produce. Not to be confused with spec-kitty's slash command
          templates.

      - name: Constitution
        definition: A project-level governance document that narrows or extends Doctrine rules for a
          specific repository. It is the execution-time selector layer for active paradigms, 
          directives, template sets, selected agent profiles, and available tools. Human-readable 
          markdown created via `/spec-kitty.constitution` in current implementation. May narrow 
          directive thresholds but must not contradict Guidelines.

          In code: Constitution command templates; parser and enforcement are evolving under Feature
            044
          Related terms: Guideline, Precedence Hierarchy, Selected Agent Profiles, Available Tools
          Precedence position: 3 (after General and Operational Guidelines; before Directives)
      - name: Selected Agent Profiles
        definition: The configured subset of doctrine agent profiles active for a specific 
          project/repository. Establishes which behavioral identities are available for 
          orchestration assignments.

      - name: Available Tools
        definition: The configured set of execution tools available to a project/repository. 
          Constrains tool selection during orchestration and agent assignment.

      - name: Precedence Hierarchy
        definition: The conflict resolution order when governance rules disagree. Higher-precedence 
          rules override lower ones. This is the governing rule for resolving conceptual conflicts 
          in governance terms.
        meta:

          Status: canonical
          In code: Defined in Feature 044 governance spec; implementation is in progress
          Related terms: Guideline, Constitution, Directive, Paradigm, Tactic
          Operational rule: When sources disagree, apply this hierarchy first; use newer accepted 
            ADRs over older ADRs; then align with current implementation behavior
      - name: Governance Plugin
        definition: An ABC that validates workflow state at lifecycle boundaries. Returns a 
          `ValidationResult` (pass/warn/block) with reasons, directive references, and suggested 
          actions. The `NullGovernancePlugin` is the default no-op implementation.

      - name: Two-Masters Problem
        definition: 'The conflict that arises when both Guidelines and the Constitution claim top-level
