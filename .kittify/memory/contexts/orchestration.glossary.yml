      - name: Orchestration Assignment
        definition: The complete binding of agent, role, and tool for a single workflow step. The 
          orchestrator constructs an assignment when dispatching work.

      - name: Feature
        definition: A bounded unit of product change tracked by spec-kitty. Contains a spec, plan, 
          tasks, and one or more work packages. Goes through the full SDD lifecycle.

          In code: Feature directory at `kitty-specs/<number>-<slug>/`
          Related terms: Work Package, Phase, Spec-Driven Development
          Note: Specs are change deltas — they describe what to change, not the final state
      - name: Research
        definition: Phase-0 discovery and evidence artifacts associated with a feature. Captures 
          unresolved questions, source references, trade-off analysis, and rationale that inform 
          specification and planning decisions.

          Location: '`kitty-specs/<feature>/research.md` and/or `kitty-specs/<feature>/research/`'
          Related terms: Feature, Spec-Driven Development (SDD), Contracts
          Distinction: Research explains *why and based on what evidence* decisions are made; 
            Specification defines *what change is requested*.
      - name: Contracts
        definition: Formal boundary definitions for a feature, typically API/event/schema/interface 
          contracts that implementation must satisfy. Used to make cross-component expectations 
          explicit before and during implementation.

          Related terms: Feature, Research, Work Package (WP)
          Distinction: Contracts define *shape and compatibility constraints* at boundaries; Plan 
            and tasks define *execution sequencing*.
      - name: Work Package (WP)
        definition: An independently implementable unit of work within a feature. Each WP gets its 
          own git worktree and branch. Tracked with frontmatter YAML including status lane, 
          dependencies, and assigned tool.

          Related terms: Feature, Lane, Worktree, Dependency Graph
          Identifiers: '`WP01`, `WP02`, etc.'
      - name: Phase
        definition: A stage in the spec-driven development lifecycle. Phases are sequential within a
          feature but WPs within a phase can run in parallel.

          Values: '`specify` → `plan` → `tasks` → `implement` → `review` → `accept` → `merge`'
      - name: Lane
        definition: The status state of a work package in the canonical lifecycle model. Lane 
          transitions are recorded as immutable status events.
        aliases:
          - '`doing` maps to `in_progress` for compatibility'

          In code: Canonical model in `src/specify_cli/status/transitions.py`; compatibility view in
            WP frontmatter `lane`
          Related terms: Work Package, Lane Transition Event
          Authority: ADR `2026-02-09-2` (latest lifecycle ADR) supersedes older 4-lane documentation
          Canonical lanes: '`planned`, `claimed`, `in_progress`, `for_review`, `done`, `blocked`, `canceled`'
      - name: Worktree
        definition: An isolated git working directory created per work package via `git worktree`. 
          Provides isolation between parallel agent work.
        aliases:
          - Run Container (ADR-048)

      - name: Dependency Graph
        definition: A directed acyclic graph (DAG) of WP dependencies within a feature. Used to 
          enforce ordering and plan parallelization waves.

      - name: Spec-Driven Development (SDD)
        definition: "Spec Kitty's core methodology. The prescribed phase sequence: spec → plan → tasks
          → implement → review → accept → merge. Code is the source of truth; specs are change requests
          (deltas)."

      - name: Mission
        definition: A versioned orchestration recipe for a domain. A mission defines workflow 
          states, transitions, guards, and required artifacts.
        meta:
          Context: Orchestration
          Status: canonical
          In code: '`src/doctrine/missions/*/mission.yaml` (v2); compatibility assets still exist under
            `src/specify_cli/missions/`'
          Related terms: Phase, Slash Command, Constitution, Tool
          Distinction: Mission defines orchestration (*what runs and when*). Constitution selects 
            and narrows active governance assets for the project.
      - name: Slash Command
        definition: An agent-facing shorthand command that triggers a spec-kitty workflow step 
          (e.g., `/spec-kitty.specify`, `/spec-kitty.plan`). Implemented as markdown prompt 
          templates deployed to tool-specific directories.

          Related terms: Mission, Phase, Tool
          Distinction: Slash commands trigger lifecycle phases; Tactics provide step-by-step 
            execution within a phase
      - name: User Journey
        definition: A structured, end-to-end description of how actors (human, AI, system) interact 
          with spec-kitty across phases, system boundaries, and coordination concerns. Unlike a User
          Story (single slice of value in `spec.md`), a User Journey maps the full flow including 
          actors, events, coordination rules, and acceptance scenarios. User Journeys are 
          architectural design artifacts that drive system evolution.

          Template: '`src/specify_cli/missions/design/templates/user-journey-template.md`'
          Distinction: User Stories live in `spec.md` and describe *what value to deliver*. User 
            Journeys live in `architecture/journeys/` and describe *how actors interact with the 
            system end-to-end*.
