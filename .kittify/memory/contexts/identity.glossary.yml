      - name: Agent
        definition: A named identity with a role, capabilities, behavioral rules, and handoff 
          patterns. An agent defines *who* performs a task and *what governance applies*. An agent 
          runs on a tool.
        examples:
          - '"Python Pedro" (implementer)'
          - '"Review Rachel" (reviewer)'
          - '"Doc Diana" (documenter)'

            \"agent\" refers to Tool."
          Fields: 'id: Unique identifier (e.g., `"python-pedro"`); name: Human-readable name (e.g., `"Python
            Pedro"`); specialization: Primary skill area (e.g., `"python"`, `"security"`); capabilities:
            What the agent can do (frozenset, e.g., `{"write-code", "write-tests"}`); required_directives:
            Directive numbers this agent must follow'
      - name: Agent Profile
        definition: The full definition document for an agent. A markdown file with YAML front 
          matter stored at `doctrine/agents/*.agent.md`. Contains identity, capabilities, required 
          directives, handoff patterns, and primer matrix.

          In code: '`AgentProfile` (dataclass), `AgentProfile.from_file()`'
          Related terms: Agent, Directive, Handoff Pattern, Primer Matrix
      - name: Role
        definition: The function an agent performs in a workflow phase. Assigned per orchestration 
          step, not permanently — the same agent profile could serve different roles across features
          or phases.

          In code: '`agent_role` field on `GovernanceContext`'
          Related terms: Agent, Phase, Orchestration Assignment
          Values: '`implementer`, `reviewer`, `architect`, `documenter`'
      - name: Handoff Pattern
        definition: A rule in an agent profile defining who receives work next. Specifies direction 
          (e.g., `after_implement`, `on_rejection`) and target agent profile ID.

      - name: Primer Matrix
        definition: A mapping in an agent profile from task type to required context documents. 
          Defines what context must be loaded before the agent starts a given task type.
        examples:
          - '`implement: [spec, plan, architecture]`, `fix: [spec, review-comments, test-output]`'
