"""Shared YAML serialization and durable-write primitives for the kernel layer.

Canonical home for the house YAML-dump conventions used by every writer that
persists a mapping (dict / ``CommentedMap``) as YAML: round-trip dumper (so
``ruamel`` comment/quote/anchor fidelity and ``CommentedMap`` inputs survive),
a wide fixed line width (so wrapped prose never fragments a scalar across
lines), and a post-dump normalizer that strips the non-semantic trailing
whitespace ``ruamel`` leaves on wrapped-scalar continuation lines.

Adopted by ``specify_cli.retrospective.writer`` (moved here verbatim) and
``specify_cli.review.arbiter`` (#3058) so both surfaces share one seam instead
of hand-rolling the same dump-then-normalize dance with drifting width
settings.

    This is a durability-enhanced sibling of :func:`kernel.atomic.atomic_write`
    (which does write-temp-then-rename but does NOT ``fsync``). It is not
    reused here because canonical mission records (retrospective, review
    artifacts) need the extra fsync/dir-fsync durability delta: without it, a
    crash immediately after ``os.replace`` can still lose the rename on some
    filesystems/power-loss scenarios, because the directory entry update was
    never flushed. ``atomic_write`` is the right choice for lower-stakes
    generated/regenerable files; this function is for records whose loss is a
    correctness problem.

    Sequence:
    1. Serialize ``data`` via :func:`serialize_mapping`.
    2. Write to a uniquely-named ``.tmp`` file in ``path.parent`` (created
       ``O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_EXCL`` so two concurrent writers never
       collide), ``fsync`` the file descriptor, close.
    3. ``os.replace(tmp, path)`` — atomic rename.
    4. Best-effort ``fsync`` on the parent directory fd to flush the rename
       into the directory inode (non-fatal on failure).

    On any failure the tempfile is unlinked and the original exception
    propagates — this function raises no kernel-specific exception type so
    callers remain free to translate failures into their own domain errors.
