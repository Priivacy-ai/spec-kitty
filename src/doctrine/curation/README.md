# Curation

`curation` holds pull-based doctrine intake records before canonization into
first-class doctrine artifacts.

Each import candidate should capture:

- source provenance
- target concept classification
- adaptation notes
- adoption status and resulting artifact links

The starter import set includes a ZOMBIES TDD example under
`imports/example-zombies/`.
