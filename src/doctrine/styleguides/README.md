# Styleguides

`styleguides` define stable writing and coding conventions that apply across
missions and templates.

Use styleguides for cross-cutting guidance such as:

- Python coding conventions
- Documentation structure conventions
- Test-writing conventions

Keep actionable implementation behavior in `tactics` and governance policy in
`directives`. Styleguides should focus on consistency and quality standards.
