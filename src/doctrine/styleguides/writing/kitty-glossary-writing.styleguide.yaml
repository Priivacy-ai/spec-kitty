title: Kitty Glossary Writing Styleguide
scope: glossary
principles:
  - "Clear, not clever: definitions exist to help the reader understand, not to demonstrate expertise."
  - "No buzzword soup: avoid stacking jargon-heavy terms into a single sentence. If a definition requires re-reading, it has failed."
  - "Functional over compositional: explain what something does, not what it is composed of."
  - "Human-focused: write for the person encountering the term for the first time, not the person who already knows it."
  - "Use Human-in-Charge (HiC) consistently: never use 'user' when referring to the human who holds decision authority."
  - "One concept per definition: if a definition needs multiple paragraphs, it may be covering more than one term."
  - "Foundational terms must be defined: if a definition depends on terms like API, CLI, YAML, or JSON, those terms must exist in the glossary."
  - "All new terms enter as candidate: the HiC promotes to canonical. This is not optional."

anti_patterns:
  - name: Buzzword Soup
    description: "Stacking technical jargon into dense, unreadable sentences."
    bad_example: "Deterministic SHA256 computed from sorted artifact content hashes enabling identity-independent comparison and parity computation."
    good_example: "Checksum computed from all artifact content hashes in a dossier, sorted to guarantee the same result regardless of scan order. If any artifact's content changes, the parity hash changes too."

  - name: Circular Definition
    description: "Defining a term using itself or equally opaque synonyms."
    bad_example: "Parity baseline is a baseline for parity tracking."
    good_example: "A saved parity hash representing the last accepted state of a dossier. Drift is detected by comparing the current parity hash against this baseline."

  - name: Implementation Leaking Into Definition
    description: "Including code-level details (class names, method signatures, file paths) in the definition body rather than in metadata fields."
    bad_example: "ArtifactClassEnum with six values defined in models.py."
    good_example: "Classification of an artifact's role in the mission lifecycle. Six values: input, workflow, output, evidence, policy, runtime."

  - name: Assuming Reader Knowledge
    description: "Using terms like API, YAML, or SHA256 without ensuring they are defined elsewhere in the glossary."
    bad_example: "YAML file that bootstraps domain entries."
    good_example: "An optional YAML file that pre-loads domain glossary terms before the runtime starts extracting new ones."

  - name: Passive Authority
    description: "Using 'the user' instead of Human-in-Charge when the human holds decision authority."
    bad_example: "A choice presented to the user during the workflow."
    good_example: "A choice presented to the Human-in-Charge (HiC) or their delegated agent during the workflow."

quality_test: "Read the definition to someone unfamiliar with the project. If they need to ask a follow-up question to understand the core concept, revise it."
