## Template Notes

* **Keep it concise**: ADRs should be 1-2 pages maximum
* **One decision per ADR**: If you have multiple decisions, create separate ADRs
* **Immutable once accepted**: Don't edit accepted ADRs; create new ones that supersede them
* **Focus on "why"**: Explain reasoning and tradeoffs, not implementation details
* **Include rejected options**: Document why alternatives were not chosen
