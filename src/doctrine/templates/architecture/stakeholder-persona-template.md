# Stakeholder Persona: {{ name }}

<!--
  Design Mission Template: Stakeholder Persona
  
  Purpose: Full profile of an actor who participates in or is affected by a
  design decision. This is the deep companion to the Actor table in
  user-journey-template.md.

  Derived from:
  - Doctrine PERSONA.md (architecture template)
  - Doctrine audience-persona-template.md (documentation template)
  
  Adaptations for design mission context:
  - Added "Design Impact" section (how design decisions affect this persona)
  - Added "Decision Authority" to Desiderata (maps to Decision Boundary concept)
  - Retained Behavioral Cues (critical for anticipating design friction)
  - Simplified Cross-Context to focus on design-relevant domains
  - Added explicit link back to User Journey actor table

  When to create:
  - During the Discover phase of the design mission
  - When an actor in a user journey needs deeper understanding
  - When stakeholder motivations would change the design direction

  When NOT to create (too heavyweight):
  - Well-understood internal roles (e.g., "CI server")
  - Actors with no design influence (pure observers)
-->

**Category**: `INTERNAL Stakeholder` | `EXTERNAL Stakeholder`
**Actor Type**: `human` | `llm` | `system`
**Primary Goal**: [What outcome are they seeking?]
**Referenced In**: [Link to user journey(s) where this actor appears]

- **Environmental Constraints**: [Budget, time, policy, or cultural barriers]

---

## Behavioral Cues

<!--
  Critical for design: anticipates how this persona will react to proposed
  changes, new workflows, or architectural shifts.
-->

| Situation | Typical Behavior | Interpretation |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Stable / Routine | | |
| Change / Uncertainty | | |
| Under Pressure | | |

## Collaboration Preferences

- **Decision Style**: [Data-driven, consensus-seeking, intuitive, precedent-based]
- **Communication Style**: [Brief updates, detailed analysis, async, face-to-face]
- **Feedback Expectations**: [What form and tone of feedback they find constructive]

---

## Design Impact

<!--
  Design-mission-specific section. Captures how design decisions affect this
  persona and what they need from the design process.
  
  This section bridges the persona to the design mission's Validate phase:
  "Does this design serve this stakeholder's needs?"
-->

- **Affected By**: [Which design decisions directly impact this persona?]
- **Needs From Design**: [What must the design provide for this persona to succeed?]
- **Risk If Ignored**: [What happens if this persona's needs aren't considered?]
- **Acceptance Signal**: [How do we know the design works for them?]

---

## Measures of Success

| Dimension | Indicator | Type |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| Performance | | [Quantitative — metrics, KPIs] |
| Quality | | [Qualitative — usability, satisfaction, accuracy] |
| Growth | | [Learning, autonomy, collaboration depth] |

---

## Narrative Summary

<!--
  A concise, humanizing synthesis (1-2 paragraphs). Combine motivation,
  constraint, and relational context. This is what helps designers empathize
  and make trade-offs around this persona.
-->

[Write a brief story-form summary that captures this persona's relationship
to the system being designed. What do they care about? What frustrates them?
What would delight them?]
