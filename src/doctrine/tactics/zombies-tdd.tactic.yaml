purpose: Drive implementation through tiny behavior increments using failing tests to control complexity.
steps:
  - title: "Z - Zero"
    description: Start with the zero case and prove baseline behavior before adding complexity.
    examples:
      - "A newly created collection reports count=0 and total=0."
  - title: "O - One"
    description: Add one concrete case and implement only what is needed for that single scenario.
    examples:
      - "Adding the first item changes count 0 -> 1 and updates aggregate state."
  - title: "M - Many"
    description: Generalize from one to many cases using the smallest safe design step.
    examples:
      - "Adding multiple items preserves ordering and calculates totals correctly."
  - title: "B - Boundary Behaviors"
    description: Capture edge and transition behaviors that often produce regressions.
    examples:
      - "Transition from zero to one and from one back to zero is explicit and tested."
  - title: "I - Interface Definition"
    description: Refine API contracts as behavior becomes clearer from tests.
    examples:
      - "Introduce explicit add/remove methods and keep return contracts stable."
  - title: "E - Exercise Exceptional Behavior"
    description: Cover failure and invalid-input behavior so error paths are intentional.
    examples:
      - "Invalid item input raises a domain error without mutating state."
  - title: "S - Simple Scenarios, Simple Solutions"
    description: Keep each test and implementation step minimal to prevent speculative complexity.
    examples:
      - "Prefer direct conditionals over abstractions until multiple tests demand refactoring."
