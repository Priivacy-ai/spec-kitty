# Research Decision Log

Document the outcomes of Phase 0 discovery work. Capture every clarification you resolved and the supporting evidence that backs each decision.

## Summary

- **Feature**: <!-- e.g., 001-pii-detection-market -->
- **Date**: <!-- YYYY-MM-DD -->
- **Researchers**: <!-- Primary collaborators -->
- **Open Questions**: <!-- Items still unanswered after Phase 0 -->

## Decisions & Rationale

For each decision, include the supporting sources and why the team aligned on this direction.

| Decision | Rationale | Evidence | Status |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------|
| <!-- e.g., "Adopt vector database X" --> | <!-- Why this choice was made --> | <!-- Link to evidence rows / notes --> | <!-- final / follow-up --> |

## Evidence Highlights

Summarize the most impactful findings from the evidence log. Link back to specific rows so the trail is auditable.

- **Key insight 1** – <!-- Cite evidence row or page reference -->
- **Key insight 2** – <!-- Cite evidence row or page reference -->
- **Risks / Concerns** – <!-- Any red flags uncovered -->

## Next Actions

Outline what needs to happen before moving into implementation planning.

1. <!-- e.g., Validate data access with security team -->
2. <!-- e.g., Schedule stakeholder read-out -->

> Keep this document living. As more evidence arrives, update decisions and rationale so downstream implementers can trust the history.
