"""FR — one-time repair for issue #254: re-pin a repo's pre-commit hook.

``policy/hook_installer.py`` pins the absolute interpreter path into the
generated pre-commit hook at install time. An install-method migration (e.g.
pipx -> uv) moves that interpreter, and the old path is simply gone the next
time someone commits — a shell-level ``No such file or directory`` naming a
path rather than a cause.

The hook's own run-time fallback (``spec-kitty`` resolved off ``PATH``, see
the hook installer module docstring) already recovers a working commit in
that case. This migration is the complementary REPAIR seam: it re-pins the
hook to the CURRENT interpreter so the fast, PATH-independent primary path
works again, without requiring an ``implement`` lane (the only other caller
of :func:`install`) — recovery would otherwise be circular, since running an
implement lane itself requires committing.

Idempotent: re-running against an already-current hook re-writes the same
effective hook (only the ``# Installed:`` timestamp comment differs).
