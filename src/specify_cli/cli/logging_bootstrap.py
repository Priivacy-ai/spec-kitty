"""CLI logging bootstrap for Spec Kitty (FR-130, FR-131).

Installs a minimal but deterministic logging configuration at CLI entry so
that ``warnings.warn(...)`` calls — including ``CharterCatalogMissWarning``
emitted by ``charter._catalog_miss.emit_catalog_miss_warning`` — are routed
through Python's logging subsystem and appear in the operator's terminal.

Background (RISK-3 from Mission B post-merge review)
-----------------------------------------------------
Before this bootstrap existed, the call-stack in
``charter._catalog_miss.emit_catalog_miss_warning`` included two surfaces:

1. ``warnings.warn(message, CharterCatalogMissWarning, ...)``
   — Python's default warning machinery may print this to stderr as
   ``source_file:line: WarningClass: message``, but ONLY once per
   (message, category, module, lineno) combination within the process,
   and the format is not operator-friendly (no log-level label, no rich
   highlighting, no consistent timestamp).

2. ``_LOGGER.warning(message, extra=extra)``
   — Silently discarded when no handler is attached to the root logger,
   meaning the structured log entry with its ``kind / id / cause /
   suggestion`` extras never reached the operator.

``install_cli_logging_bootstrap()`` solves both problems:

* ``logging.captureWarnings(True)`` routes ``warnings.warn`` calls through
  the ``logging.warnings`` logger so they appear alongside ordinary log
  records rather than through Python's separate warnings machinery.
* A ``rich.logging.RichHandler`` (or a minimal stderr ``StreamHandler``
  fallback when Rich is not importable) is attached to the root logger so
  that WARNING-level records — from both the ``logging.warnings`` logger and
  module-level loggers like ``charter._catalog_miss._LOGGER`` — reach
  the terminal.

Idempotency / no double-printing
---------------------------------
``install_cli_logging_bootstrap()`` checks ``root.handlers`` before adding
the Spec Kitty handler.  If the root logger already has a handler (e.g.
because a command sets up its own handler, or a test installs one before
importing), the function does **not** add another one.  This prevents
double-printing when commands configure their own logging.

This function MUST be called before the Typer app runs, ideally as the
very first statement in ``specify_cli.__init__.main()`` — before any
import that might trigger a warning.

Usage
-----
Import from the entry point module only::

    from specify_cli.cli.logging_bootstrap import install_cli_logging_bootstrap
    install_cli_logging_bootstrap()

Public API
----------
- :func:`install_cli_logging_bootstrap` — idempotent bootstrap entry point.
- :data:`_HANDLER_SENTINEL` — module-level sentinel used by the idempotency
  guard; exposed for testing.

    """Install the Spec Kitty CLI logging bootstrap (idempotent).

    Effect (human/default mode):
    * Calls ``logging.captureWarnings(True)`` so ``warnings.warn(...)``
      calls are routed through the ``logging.warnings`` logger instead of
      Python's raw warning machinery.
    * Attaches a Rich-aware (or plain stderr fallback) handler at WARNING
      level to the root logger when no handler is already present.

    The function is a **no-op** if the root logger already has at least one
    handler, preserving any logging configuration that a command or test has
    installed before the bootstrap runs.

    ``json_mode`` (machine mode — the CLI was invoked with ``--json``):
    diagnostics are made SILENT instead. Agents commonly invoke
    ``spec-kitty … --json 2>&1`` and parse the *merged* stream, so any
    warning/log line on stderr corrupts the JSON object. In this mode the
    bootstrap silences every root handler (and installs a ``NullHandler`` when
    none exist, so Python's ``lastResort`` WARNING→stderr fallback never fires)
    — which suppresses both ordinary log records and ``captureWarnings``-routed
    warnings without mutating the global ``warnings`` filter. A successful
    ``--json`` run therefore emits only the JSON object; commands still emit
    genuine errors as JSON on stdout themselves (not via logging).

    Idempotency is enforced by the ``root.handlers`` check, **not** by a
    module-level flag, so the function behaves correctly even if the
    logging state was cleared between calls (e.g. in tests that call
    ``logging.root.handlers.clear()``).

    Thread safety: CPython's logging module is thread-safe for handler
    mutation; this function does not need additional locking.
