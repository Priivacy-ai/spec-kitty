"""Checkout-identity guard — the single canonical authority for invocation
ownership and the single fail-closed write-refusal seam.

Mission ``worktree-root-resolution-01M0B59R`` WP01 (FR-001, FR-008; C-1, C-2;
data-model INV-1…INV-6).

Reframe (post-plan squad, 2026-08-18): the discarded
``CheckoutKind {PRIMARY, LINKED_WORKTREE, STANDALONE_CLONE}`` classifier is
gone. A standalone clone already resolves to itself and the clone-vs-primary
split is undecidable from local git state — and *moot*, because a clone owns
itself. The decidable, load-bearing distinction is **invocation ownership**:
does this invocation own the checkout it is about to write, or is it a foreign
lane worktree whose canonical write deliberately lives on the primary?

Ownership is decided by parsing ``.git`` **DIRECTLY** (INV-4):

* ``cwd``'s own ``.git`` is a **directory** ⇒ this checkout is its own root.
  It owns itself. This covers the primary checkout *and* a nested standalone
  clone alike — both are their own canonical target. Crucially, the guard does
  **not** re-anchor a nested clone to the outer primary; that re-anchoring is
  exactly the WP07 ``find_repo_root`` defect, and routing this decision through
  ``get_main_repo_root`` / ``locate_project_root`` / ``resolve_canonical_root``
  would couple this foundation to WP07 and make the nested-clone ownership
  assertion unsatisfiable.
* ``cwd``'s ``.git`` is a **worktree-pointer file** (``gitdir:`` naming
  ``…/.git/worktrees/<name>``) ⇒ this is a linked worktree. Its
  ``canonical_target`` is the primary repo root the pointer names (the
  deliberate #2320/#3328 anchor), and it does **not** own that primary: a
  ``WRITE`` from here fails closed.

Read/write intent keeps the deliberate primary reads intact (INV-2): a
``PRIMARY_READ`` returns ``canonical_target`` unchanged regardless of ``cwd`` —
the must-not-flip anchors (``get_feature_target_branch``,
``resolve_merge_target_branch``, ``mission_runtime`` primary-metadata reads) are
never redirected to the invoking worktree.

The module is deliberately dependency-light (stdlib only) so it stays genuinely
independent of the ``paths.py`` re-anchoring resolvers. The worktree-pointer
parsing mirrors ``core/paths.py`` (``_is_worktree_gitdir`` /
``get_main_repo_root``) rather than importing it, to keep that independence.
