"""Shipped default-profile bindings for built-in mission steps (#4115).

Leaf module: stdlib-only imports, so the operator surfaces that only need
the binding tables (``charter deactivate``'s warning, ``charter preflight``'s
advisory warnings — both on hot or interactive paths) do not pay the
``mission_step_contracts.executor`` import chain (``specify_cli.invocation``,
glossary chokepoint, ~1s cold).

``StepContractExecutor`` re-exports everything here, so the pre-existing
import sites (``runtime_bridge_composition``, the composition tests) that
read ``_ACTION_PROFILE_DEFAULTS`` off the executor module keep working
unchanged.
