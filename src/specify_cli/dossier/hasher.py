"""Deterministic SHA256 hashing utilities for mission artifacts.

This module is the single owning definition (C-001) of the **canonical
dossier snapshot hash** used across the CLI and the SaaS server
(spec-kitty#2180). It also provides per-artifact content hashing and the
normalized WP static-projection input the snapshot hash is computed over.

Canonical dossier snapshot hash (:func:`compute_dossier_snapshot_hash`):
    sort entries by artifact path; join ``"{path}\\t{content_hash}"`` lines
    with newlines; ``sha256`` the utf-8 bytes; prefix the hex digest with
    ``sha256:``. This is byte-identical to the server's
    ``apps/dossier/materialize.py::_compute_snapshot_hash`` (cross-repo
    contract C-003). The prior concat-of-hashes / bare-hex form is retired.

See: kitty-specs/dossier-parity-reconciler-01KXYXVP/spec.md (FR-001..FR-003,
C-001, C-004) and kitty-specs/042-local-mission-dossier-authority-parity-export/data-model.md

    Algorithm:
        1. Sort ``(artifact_path, content_hash)`` entries by path (tuple sort).

    list hashes the empty string, a stable sentinel shared with the server.
