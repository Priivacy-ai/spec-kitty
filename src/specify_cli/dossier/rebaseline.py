"""One-time re-baseline of recorded snapshot hashes (FR-009, NFR-003, WP05).

WP02 migrated the CLI emit path onto the canonical dossier snapshot hash
(``sha256:``-prefixed, computed over the normalized WP static projection —
see :func:`specify_cli.dossier.hasher.compute_dossier_snapshot_hash`). Snapshot
hashes recorded *before* that cutover were persisted under the retired
concat-of-hashes / bare-hex formula and over the old raw-byte per-artifact
basis, so they are non-comparable with a freshly computed canonical hash. Left
alone they would read as divergent even when nothing changed.

This module provides the one-time re-baseline that recomputes recorded snapshot
hashes under the canonical definition, so unchanged content reconciles as
PARITY after the cutover (FR-009) with zero false-divergence across the local
backlog (NFR-003). It is acceptable to recompute historical hashes because
there are no live hosted customers (spec Assumption A-003).

Design guarantees:

- **Canonical, not re-implemented (C-001).** The hash is produced by re-running
  the live pipeline — :class:`specify_cli.dossier.indexer.Indexer` →
  :func:`specify_cli.dossier.snapshot.compute_snapshot` — the SAME path the
  drift/reconcile surface uses. It does not transform recorded component hashes
  (those carry the retired raw-byte WP basis and would not match a reconcile).
- **Read-only over source artifacts (#2263).** Indexing only reads the mission
  source tree; the re-baseline writes solely to the recorded
  ``.kittify/dossiers/<slug>/snapshot-latest.json`` cache file, never to a
  source artifact.
- **Idempotent.** A snapshot already in the canonical (``sha256:``-prefixed)
  form is left byte-for-byte untouched, so re-running is a no-op.
- **Full re-snapshot, NOT a pure hash reformat (#2883 item 7).** A non-canonical
  recorded hash is replaced by recomputing over *current* source, so any source
  change made since the last emit is absorbed into the new baseline. In other
  words re-baseline silently advances the recorded hash to current source and
  thereby masks any pre-cutover drift. This is intentional for the one-time
  cutover and bounded by A-003 (no live hosted customers); a later reader must
  not mistake it for reformatting the stored value in place.

See: kitty-specs/dossier-parity-reconciler-01KXYXVP/spec.md (FR-009, NFR-003,
A-003) and tasks/WP05-rebaseline-migration.md (T019-T021).

Org-awareness (FR-003, mission cascade-org-inert-01M07E9P, WP01)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Until this WP, ``Indexer`` was constructed with no ``repo_root``
(``Indexer(ManifestRegistry())``), so a configured org pack's
``expected-artifacts.yaml`` override never reached ``rebaseline`` — unlike
every other caller of ``Indexer`` (``reconcile.py``, ``sync/dossier_pipeline.py``,
both already thread ``repo_root``).

**T001 worktree investigation (outcome (a) — worktrees never carry dossier
snapshots). Historical evidence trail, recorded before the sync transport was
deleted (issue #5): every ``sync/dossier_pipeline.py`` site it names is gone,
the conclusion (worktrees never carry snapshots) still describes this module's
guarantee.** Evidence trail. ``Indexer.__init__``'s docstring frames
``repo_root`` as the value threaded into
``manifest_registry.load_manifest(mission_type, repo_root=...)``
(``indexer.py:89-102``); the sole write site for a recorded snapshot is
``save_snapshot`` (``dossier/snapshot.py:154``), called from exactly one
production function, the private helper ``_emit_snapshot``
(``sync/dossier_pipeline.py:117``, ``save_snapshot`` call at line 140).
``_emit_snapshot`` has exactly one caller, ``sync_feature_dossier``
(``sync/dossier_pipeline.py:264``, calls ``_emit_snapshot`` at line 355),
itself only ever invoked via ``trigger_feature_dossier_sync_if_enabled``
(``sync/dossier_pipeline.py:413``). Reaching that function is possible two
ways — DIRECT calls, and one INDIRECT fan-out registered at import time —
both traced below.

*(A) Direct calls.* Nine production call sites call
``trigger_feature_dossier_sync_if_enabled`` (or a same-named thin wrapper
around it) directly:
``cli/commands/agent/tasks_mark_status.py``, ``workflow_executor.py`` (the
``implement``/claim path), ``mission_finalize.py``,
``mission_setup_plan.py``, ``mission_record_analysis.py``, ``research.py``,
``merge/executor.py:1300`` (``_phase_dossier_and_stale``, the
``spec-kitty merge`` post-merge phase — passes ``run.main_repo``, a field
explicitly named/typed as the main checkout), and two migration flows —
``migration/backfill_identity.py:265-277`` (``_rehash_modified_missions``,
the ``migrate backfill-identity`` flow) and
``migration/normalize_mission_lifecycle.py:108-111``
(``_apply_identity_normalization``, the ``migrate
normalize-mission-lifecycle`` flow). All nine resolve their own
``repo_root`` via ``locate_project_root()`` (``core/paths.py:182`` —
docstring: "Locate the MAIN spec-kitty project root directory, **even from
within worktrees**" / "returns Path to MAIN project root (not worktree)"),
the equivalent ``find_repo_root()`` (``task_utils/support.py:45``, itself
delegating to the same primitive), or ``get_main_repo_root()``
(``core/paths.py:451`` — "Get the main repository root, even if called from
a worktree" — reached transitively via ``workflow.py:791``,
``main_repo_root = get_main_repo_root(repo_root)``, which
``workflow_executor.py`` then takes as given per its own docstring at
``workflow_executor.py:513-515``); the two ``migrate_cmd.py`` flows call
``locate_project_root()`` directly (``cli/commands/migrate_cmd.py:265`` for
``backfill-identity``, and the equivalent pattern at the sibling
``normalize-mission-lifecycle`` command). ``migrate rebaseline`` itself
(``cli/commands/migrate_cmd.py``, ``rebaseline_dossier_hashes``) resolves
its own ``repo_root`` the same way.

*(B) Indirect fan-out — removed (issue #677).* This section previously
traced a second pathway into ``trigger_feature_dossier_sync_if_enabled``:
``sync/__init__.py``'s ``_dossier_sync_handler``, registered at import time
via ``register_default_handlers()``, forwarded into it via
``status/adapters.py``'s ``fire_dossier_sync``/``register_dossier_sync_handler``
registry, fired from ``status/emit.py`` (inside
``emit_status_transition``/``emit_status_transition_batch``) and the
transactional wrapper's ``_defer_dossier_sync``. That registrant lived in
``sync/__init__.py``, which issue #5 deleted along with the rest of the sync
transport — leaving the registry with zero production registrants ever
since: every call to ``fire_dossier_sync`` fanned out over an empty handler
list and was, in practice, a no-op. Issue #677 removed the now-dead seam
(``fire_dossier_sync``, ``register_dossier_sync_handler``, the registry, and
every call site) rather than leave a permanently-empty registry in place.
The worktree-safety analysis this section used to carry no longer applies —
there is no fan-out left to be worktree-unsafe.

``.kittify/dossiers/`` is also gitignored (``.gitignore:66,82,86,87``), so a
worktree checkout cannot inherit a stray recorded snapshot via git either.

Net: with (B) gone, every real write path for a recorded snapshot is a
direct call from (A) above, and every one of those nine call sites resolves
its own ``repo_root`` via ``get_main_repo_root()``, ``find_repo_root()``, or
``locate_project_root()`` — all worktree-aware, all resolving to the
PRIMARY/main checkout. So a recorded snapshot still never gets written from
a ``.worktrees/<slug>-<mid8>-lane-<id>/`` path; that invariant no longer
depends on how any indirect fan-out resolves ``repo_root``, since none
remains.

**Fail-safe, not forced.** The derivation still only holds because every
production writer's PRIMARY-partition resolution is literally
``<repo_root>/KITTY_SPECS_DIR/<mission_slug>`` — a structural invariant, not
merely an assumption. ``_derive_repo_root`` below checks that invariant
(``feature_dir.parent.name == KITTY_SPECS_DIR``) before deriving anything,
and returns ``None`` (today's org-blind behavior) when it does not hold —
e.g. a hand-placed or legacy-layout snapshot not nested under
``kitty-specs/``. A wrong ``repo_root`` is worse than none: it would silently
read a *different* project's org config.
