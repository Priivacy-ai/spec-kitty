"""Enumerated raw-append access to ``status.events.jsonl`` (FR-010).

Why this module exists
----------------------
The status FSM (``status/emit.py`` and ``coordination/transaction.py``) is
the sole authority over what lands in a mission's ``status.events.jsonl``:
it validates the transition, takes the mission status lock (L1), appends,
materializes, and fans out. The raw append primitives in ``status/store.py``
bypass every one of those steps -- they are the durability mechanism, not a
write door. Mission ``fsm-write-path-integrity-01M1TZV6`` found four raw
writers that had grown around the FSM without its lock (WP01 census families
4-7, ``design-notes/WP01-lock-rules.md`` section 1), and its own writes gate
then found a fifth (family 8, WP07 addendum); the facade used to hand those
primitives to anyone who asked, so the census decayed silently.

This module is the ONLY sanctioned import path for those primitives from
outside ``specify_cli.status``. The public facade (``specify_cli.status``)
no longer exports them; ``from specify_cli.status import append_event`` is an
``ImportError``. Modules inside ``specify_cli.status`` may keep importing
``store`` directly (same-package reuse).

What is allowed
---------------
``ALLOWED_CALLERS`` enumerates every module that may reach a raw append
primitive -- through this module, through ``status.store`` directly (the
in-package shells), or through the ``coordination.status_service`` wrappers
that delegate here (analysis finding I1: a boundary-exempt module must not be
able to reach the store behind the gate's back). Each entry names the WP01
census family it belongs to. The set is **shrink-only**: an entry may be
removed when a writer is retired, but a new writer must route through the
FSM (``emit_status_transition`` / ``BookkeepingTransaction``), not be added
here.

What enforces it
----------------
``tests/architectural/test_status_unsafe_allowlist.py`` AST-scans ``src/``
for every raw-append door and fails when an importer is not in
``ALLOWED_CALLERS``, when ``ALLOWED_CALLERS`` is not a subset of the test's
committed baseline (shrink-only), or when an entry no longer imports a door
(stale entry). ``tests/architectural/test_status_events_writes_gate.py``
(FR-011) independently fails any write-mode open of a ``status.events.jsonl``
path outside ``status/store.py``. Both gates carry non-vacuity floors.
