"""Token budget enforcement and fetch substitution (WP05 T019, NFR-001).

The augmented WP prompt MUST stay under a configurable character budget
(default 32 000 chars, ~8 000 tokens at 4 chars/token).  When the rendered
governance payload exceeds the budget, the longest section bodies are
auto-substituted with the canonical fetch + when-doing stanza
(:func:`charter.activation.context_renderers.fetch_stanza.fetch_stanza`) until the
budget is met.

Substitution algorithm (deterministic, order-independent):

1. Render the join of all sections; if ``len <= budget``, return as-is.
2. Sort substitutable sections by body length (longest first), breaking
   ties on ``section_id`` ascending so the same input always produces the
   same output (no dict-iteration assumption).
3. Pop the longest; replace its body with the canonical fetch stanza
   derived from the ``selector`` + ``when_doing_clause`` carried by the
   section descriptor.
4. Re-render; if still over budget, repeat with the next-longest.
5. When all substitutable bodies have been replaced, emit a single
   trailing warning line so the executing agent knows which surface to
   fetch:

       ``# Governance payload: <N> sections substituted with fetch
       commands (budget=<B>).``

Sections marked ``substitutable=False`` (e.g. the small authority-paths
block, core-doctrine sections) stay inline regardless of body length.

The returned tuple is ``(joined_text, substitution_notes)`` where
``substitution_notes`` is a list of human-readable strings describing
the swaps; callers may log this so operators can audit which sections
got swapped.

    """A single rendered section eligible for token-budget substitution.

    Attributes
    ----------
    section_id:
        Stable identifier used to break ties when sorting by body length
        and to surface in substitution notes.  Examples: ``"profile-cited-
        directives"``, ``"directive:DIRECTIVE_010"``, ``"section:
        terminology-canon"``.
    header:
        Optional leading line(s) emitted verbatim — the substitution
        algorithm never touches the header so anchors like ``Profile-Cited
        Directives (python-pedro):`` survive a swap.  Pass empty string
        for sections that have no separate header.
    body:
        The verbatim section body (potentially very long).  Substitution
        replaces this with the canonical fetch stanza when the section
        is selected.
    selector:
        Canonical ``<kind>:<identifier>`` selector for the fetch stanza
        (see :func:`charter.activation.context_renderers.fetch_stanza.format_selector`).
        Empty selector implies the section has no fetch path — in that
        case the section is treated as non-substitutable regardless of
        the ``substitutable`` flag.
    when_doing_clause:
        Verb-phrase completing the ``When you <clause>, ...`` sentence
        in the fetch stanza.  Empty falls back to
        :data:`charter.activation.context_renderers.fetch_stanza.DEFAULT_WHEN_CLAUSE`.
    substitutable:
        ``True`` when the section may be replaced with a fetch stanza
        under budget pressure.  Authority-paths and core-doctrine blocks
        carry ``False`` to keep them inline (they are small + critical).
    indent:
        Optional indentation applied to the fetch stanza lines when the
        section is substituted, so substituted output remains aligned
        with the surrounding list structure.

longer ambiguous, because a space can never be the first captured
character. The only behavioural difference from the old pattern is on the
degenerate whitespace-only body ``"###    "`` (marker + only spaces): the
old pattern captured a single trailing space; the new pattern requires a

    Doctrine, References) stays byte-identical.

    Authority paths stay inline unconditionally (they are never added as
    a candidate at all — see the caller in ``bootstrap_text.py`` /
    ``compact_governance.py``).
