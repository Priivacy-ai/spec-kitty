# Spec Kitty Documentation

This site is versioned by product line.

## Choose Your Track

| Track | Use when | Entry point |
|---|---|---|
| `1.x` | You are maintaining or operating legacy local-first workflows. | [Open 1.x docs](1x/index.md) |
| `2.x` | You are building on current doctrine, glossary, constitution, and runtime architecture. | [Open 2.x docs](2x/index.md) |

## Documentation Scope for This Release

The versioned tracks on this site cover local-first workflow and architecture only.

## Verification Notes

Versioned docs are tested for:

1. Relative-link integrity.
2. Required version-track pages.
3. Exclusion of out-of-scope hosted-platform terminology in `docs/1x/` and `docs/2x/`.
