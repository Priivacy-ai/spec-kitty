## Latest Release: 3.1.9

Spec Kitty 3.1.9 (released 2026-05-21) is a focused `3.1.x` stability hotfix:

- **Acceptance and task parsing hotfixes** — matrix extension fields survive persistence and enforcement, negative invariants avoid self-matches, unresolved clarification markers are caught, and dependency prose no longer creates false-positive work-package edges.
- **Upgrade, intake, and doctrine hardening** — schema stamping, mission brief hashes, and pack-relative toolguide validation are corrected on the stable 3.1 line.

**Upgrading from 3.0.x?** Run `spec-kitty upgrade` — all renames happen automatically.

See the full [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) for complete release notes.

## Version Tracks

|---|---|---|

## Verification Notes

Versioned docs are tested for:

1. Relative-link integrity.
2. Required version-track pages.
3. Exclusion of out-of-scope hosted-platform terminology in `docs/1x/` and `docs/2x/`.
