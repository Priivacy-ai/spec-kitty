# Test-flakiness handling policy

A *flaky* test is one whose pass/fail outcome changes between runs **without any
change to the code under test** — it sometimes goes red on CI for reasons
unrelated to the diff under review. Flakes waste review cycles and, left
unmanaged, normalise a red CI that everyone learns to ignore.

This page is the suite-wide policy for handling them: how we **detect** a flake,
what we are allowed to do about it (and explicitly *not* allowed to do), and the
current disposition of every known flake surface in this repo.

> **The one rule that governs everything below:** we never make a test pass by
> *retrying it until it goes green*. A green-after-retry is the
> "fixed because it looks fixed" trap — it hides genuine regressions and is
> incompatible with this repo's live-evidence / anti-laziness discipline. Retry
> plugins (`pytest-rerunfailures`, the PyPI `flaky` plugin) are therefore **not
> adopted**, and are not present in the dependency set.

## ⚠️ Naming: `flaky` the marker is *not* "flaky" the concept

This repo already registers a `flaky` pytest marker, and it means something
**narrow and unrelated** to this policy. Per
[ADR 2026-04-20-1](../../docs/adr/3.x/2026-04-20-1-mutation-testing-as-local-only-quality-gate.md),
`@pytest.mark.flaky` means *"passes reliably in the main suite but is
non-deterministic **under `mutmut` / forking pipelines**"* — it is a deselection
bucket for the mutation-testing sandbox, **not** a CI-quarantine mechanism.

Do not reach for the `flaky` marker to deal with a CI flake. If a genuine
quarantine mechanism is ever needed, it must use a **different** name
(`quarantine`, see below) so the two never get conflated.

## The three tiers

Every flake in this suite falls into one of three tiers, and each tier has a
single sanctioned response.

| Tier | What it is | Example | Sanctioned response |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Threshold / budget gate** | A test that asserts a measurement stays under a wall-clock / size budget. CI runners are shared and noisy, so a generous gate occasionally trips with no real regression. | NFR-002 latency (`tests/architectural/test_wp_prompt_build_latency.py`), `doctor restart-daemon` timing, the `-m timing` gate. | **Tune the budget — never retry.** Widen the budget to absorb runner variance. A *real* regression adds time **consistently** and still trips a generous gate; a retry would mask exactly that. Investigate before bumping; the budget is the gate, not the regression. |
| **2. Correctness test** | A test of logical behaviour that should be 100% deterministic. If it flakes, the test (or the code) has a hidden nondeterminism — shared global state, ordering assumptions, fixture-teardown races, monkeypatch leakage, import-time side effects. | `tests/specify_cli/shims/test_registry.py` (parallel-collection nondeterminism). | **Fix the root cause — never retry.** A correctness test that needs a retry is lying. Find the nondeterminism and remove it. |
| **3. Genuinely environmental** | A test that depends on an OS-global resource — real TCP ports, singleton daemons, the real filesystem — that cannot be fully isolated per worker. | Real-port / daemon suites (`tests/sync/test_orphan_sweep.py`, ports 9400–9449). | **Surgical handling only.** First serialise (`-n0`) and isolate (per-worker HOME) — see [testing-parallel.md](testing-parallel.md). Only if a residual, irreducible environmental flake remains do we **quarantine** (below) — never a blanket retry. |

## Detection: confirm a flake before you treat it

One red run is a single data point — pytest alone cannot tell *flaky* from
*broken*. Before declaring a test "flaky" and applying any of the responses
above, **reproduce the nondeterminism**:

- Re-run the test in isolation, and under the parallel runner it failed on:
  ```bash
  PWHEADLESS=1 pytest <path> -n auto --dist loadfile -p no:cacheprovider
  ```
- For ordering / hash-seed flakes, re-run under different `PYTHONHASHSEED`
  values and diff the collected node IDs.
- For a confidence signal, use the existing **stability ratchet** — N consecutive
  green parallel runs, the same gate CI uses for shard flips. The authoritative
  invocation lives in
  [testing-parallel.md → Running the stability ratchet locally](testing-parallel.md#running-the-stability-ratchet-locally);
  point it at the suspect `<path>` instead of fabricating a new command.
  (Full harness: `tests/_support/coverage_safety/README.md`.)

A test that cannot be made to fail again under these probes is **not** confirmed
flaky — do not annotate it.

## Tooling decision

**No retry tooling — ever.** `pytest-rerunfailures` / PyPI `flaky` are
deliberately not in the dependency set (see the rule at the top). Detection and
isolation reuse what the repo already has; the only thing built specifically for
this policy is the `quarantine` marker.

- **No retry plugin.** See the rule at the top.
- **Detection** uses the existing stability ratchet
  (`tests._support.coverage_safety.ratchet`), not a new confidence tool.
- **Isolation** (the first line of defence for Tier 3) is the existing
  per-worker HOME isolation + serial `-n0` pass documented in
  [testing-parallel.md](testing-parallel.md).

### `quarantine` — built, env-gated, non-blocking

The sanctioned mechanism for an irreducible Tier-3 flake is a dedicated
`quarantine` marker — **not** a retry, and **not** the existing `flaky` marker.
It is implemented as a single, un-bypassable chokepoint:

1. **Registered** canonically in `pytest.ini`'s `markers` block — the single
   source of truth for the marker registry (#2034) — sufficient for
   `--strict-markers`.
2. **Held out of every normal run.** `tests/conftest.py`'s
   `pytest_collection_modifyitems` skips any `@pytest.mark.quarantine` test
   **unless `SPEC_KITTY_RUN_QUARANTINE=1`**. Because this is collection-time and
   global, no `-m` selector in any CI job (present or future) can accidentally
   run a quarantined test — the gate cannot be forgotten. The opt-in is strict
   (only the literal `"1"`); the pure decision lives in
   `tests/_support/quarantine.py` and is unit-tested.
3. **Visible, never blocking.** The `quarantine-visibility` job in
   `ci-quality.yml` sets `SPEC_KITTY_RUN_QUARANTINE=1` and runs `-m quarantine`
   for real, so a quarantined flake is still **seen failing** — never silently
   retried to green. The job is deliberately **excluded from the `quality-gate`
   aggregation** (and must stay out of branch-protection required checks), so it
   can never turn `main` red or block an unrelated PR. It tolerates an empty
   quarantine set (pytest exit code 5) so "nothing quarantined" is green.

**To quarantine a test:** mark it `@pytest.mark.quarantine` with a one-line
reason **and a tracking-issue link** — every quarantined test is tech debt with
an owner. The wiring above (`test_quarantine_marker.py`) is enforced.

As of this writing **no test is quarantined** (see the disposition table — every
known surface is fixed or correctly handled). The mechanism exists so the first
irreducible flake has a sanctioned home instead of a retry.

## Audit + disposition of known flake surfaces

| Surface | Tier | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/architectural/test_wp_prompt_build_latency.py` (NFR-002 latency) | 1 | **Resolved — keep tuning.** Budget already widened 8.0 → 10.0s after a shared runner measured 8.50s with no code regression (PR #2036). The file carries inline rationale that *is* the Tier-1 policy. No further change. |
| `doctor restart-daemon` NFR-002 timing, `-m timing` gate | 1 | **Policy-covered.** Treat as a budget gate: tune, never retry. Runs only in dedicated timing jobs (`-m timing` is excluded from the fast suite). |
| `tests/sync/test_orphan_sweep.py` (real ports 9400–9449, daemons) | 3 | **Resolved — already serialised.** Runs in its own `-n0` serial pass, excluded from the parallel pool (CLAUDE.md / testing-parallel.md). No quarantine needed. |
| `tests/specify_cli/shims/test_registry.py` (parallel-collection nondeterminism) | 2 | **Fixed at root cause.** Parametrising over `list(<frozenset>)` produced a `PYTHONHASHSEED`-dependent case order, so xdist workers collected different orders ("Different tests were collected between gw0 and gwN"). Changed to `sorted(<frozenset>)`, making collection order deterministic across workers. Verified: identical node-id order under different hash seeds. |

## Adding a new test? Avoid the common root causes

When a correctness (Tier 2) test flakes, it is almost always one of these — fix
the cause, do not retry:

- **Unordered data used where order matters.** Iterating a `set`/`frozenset`/`dict`
  for parametrize IDs or assertion sequences → `PYTHONHASHSEED`-dependent order.
  Wrap in `sorted(...)`.
- **Fixture-teardown races / leaked global state** between tests sharing a module
  or process.
- **`monkeypatch` / env-var leakage** across tests (rely on the per-worker HOME
  isolation; don't mutate process-global state without restoring it).
- **Import-time side effects** that bind a path or singleton before fixtures run.
- **Time-sensitive assertions** in a non-timing test — move the timing concern to
  a Tier-1 budget gate with a generous threshold, or remove the wall-clock
  dependency.
