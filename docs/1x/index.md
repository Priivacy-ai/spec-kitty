# 1.x Documentation (Legacy Track)

`1.x` is the stable local-first workflow track.

## What 1.x Covers

1. Spec-driven workflow: `specify -> plan -> tasks -> implement -> review -> merge`.
2. Mission-oriented command templates for consistent delivery.
3. Work-package execution with branch/worktree isolation.
4. Local project governance through constitution artifacts.

## Core File Layout (1.x)

1. `kitty-specs/<feature>/spec.md`
2. `kitty-specs/<feature>/plan.md`
3. `kitty-specs/<feature>/tasks.md`
4. `.kittify/memory/constitution.md` (legacy location in 1.x)

## Start Here

1. [Workflow](workflow.md)
2. [Artifacts and Commands](artifacts-and-commands.md)
3. [Orchestration and API Boundary](orchestration-and-api.md)
4. [Branch and Workspace Model](branches-and-workspaces.md)
