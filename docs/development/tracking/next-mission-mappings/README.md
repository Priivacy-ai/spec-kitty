# `next` Mission Mapping Tracker

This directory tracks mission-specific `spec-kitty next` mapping/template gaps that are accepted temporarily.

Status rules:

1. `OPEN`: known gap is accepted short-term, guarded by `xfail(strict=True)` test.
2. `CLOSED`: full behavior implemented, `xfail` converted to normal passing test.

Open items:

1. `plan` mission: `issue-plan-mission-next-mapping.md`
2. `documentation` mission: `issue-documentation-mission-next-mapping.md`
