# Verification round — three-lens review of the finalized authorities

> **Retired (deprecated).** Superseded by the canonical creed AUTHORITY doc [foundational-values-and-creed.md](../foundational-values-and-creed.md). Preserved as a historical record.

> **EVIDENCE + the applied fix record.** Three profile-loaded lenses ran read-only against the
> corpus at `0fcb4b3d2` after the publication-readiness rewrite. Every finding below marked ✅ was
> **applied in the finalization commit**; the authorities are post-fix. This file is the record of
> what the round found and what changed.

## Aggregated verdict

**The measurements hold up; the coordination layer needed one more pass — and got it.**

- **The reproducibility claim is substantially TRUE, and unusually strong.** The debugger lens
  recomputed ~60 figures by deliberately independent methods (characteristic polynomial +
  Durand–Kerner instead of the script's power iteration; its own Jacobi PCA instead of trusting
  any published series). **Every substantive number in §6.1–6.4, §10.2, the negative-cell census,
  and all five grep counts reproduced — most to more decimals than published.** Exactly two
  published figures were off: a mean (0.3842 → **0.3841**) and a symmetry count (48/49 → **47/49
  cells; one asymmetric pair of 21**). Neither moves any conclusion.
- **Two genuine HIGH defects were found in the maths layer, both now fixed:**
  1. **The reference spectral-radius method was fail-open** (F-1). Power iteration from a fixed
     all-ones start reports gain **0.33** for a two-camp ±1 basis whose true gain is exactly
     **1.0** — because all-ones is an eigenvector of a *smaller* eigenvalue. AMMERSE's own figures
     were never affected (real dominant eigenvalue, non-deficient start), but the method would
     have shipped into the validator §6.2 calls load-bearing at exactly the boundary case. **Fix
     applied:** the committed script now uses seeded random restarts (verified: reports 3.0/2.0
     correctly on both counterexamples, AMMERSE unchanged), and §6.2 documents the hazard.
  2. **The `(1−r)` bounding claim confused the spectral norm with the sup-norm** (F-2). A per-axis
     [−1, 1] guarantee is an ℓ∞ statement; the tight two-term constant is `1/(1+r∞)` with
     `r∞ = 0.5·max_row_abs_sum/(N−1)` — **0.75** for AMMERSE (verified exactly tight: worst
     admissible ±1 base lands at 1.000000, while `(1−r) = 0.8054` overflows to **1.074**). And no
     fixed constant bounds a *sum* of deltas — the active-set composition must clamp or average
     first, recorded as an open design consequence. **Fix applied** in §6.4 + register.
- **The sequence document — the one authority that never had a review pass — turned out to carry
  the fewest unverifiable claims** (all seven of its `file:line` citations resolve, six exactly;
  all three precedent anchors reproduce to the file and line), **but its coordination layer had
  five executable blockers**, all now fixed: a decision-ID namespace collision (`Dn` ADR decisions
  vs `D-n` design decisions, colliding on different meanings → renamed **`ADR-Dn`**); a false
  "last band entirely behind G2/G3" claim (truth: roughly half — I15 is behind `#2467`, I10 behind
  G4, I13/I1c ungated); two missing increments in the critical path (I3c, I8) and an unranked gate
  (G5); the `consistency_check` re-point range excluding one function it must re-point
  (934→**917**); and two surviving pre-review `49/49` figures.
- **The design doc's §0 ask was priced on the wrong band** (fresh-eyes lens): the "Prose-only (§8)"
  row carried the ranks-1–4 campsite figures, while §8's own `costs:` field is sequence rank 19
  with a 196–228-artefact authoring sweep. **Fixed:** the row is relabeled, §8 is priced honestly,
  and the headline "~85% behind two gates" — which reproduced from no column of the effort table —
  is now "**~60–65% of tabulated engineering cost in the final band, roughly half of it behind the
  two gates, the authoring tail entirely behind `#2538`**".
- **The 1,820-cell figure was never re-derived after §7.4 narrowed the kind set** — it counted
  toolguide/step-contract/glossary_pack artefacts the design excludes. Canonical: **~1,372–1,596**
  (196–228 × 7). Fixed in both authorities + register.
- **The register's own account of the superseded "~6%" was wrong** (it said "undamped three-term",
  which is 9.65%; the 6% was `gain³ = 5.89%`, the first-omitted-term magnitude). Fixed — the one
  row that cannot afford to be wrong is the one explaining a previous error.
- **Corpus-wide figure hygiene:** the evidence docs still published superseded numbers with no
  pointer (the matrix-measurement doc even *endorses the three-term composition the authority
  forbids*). **Fixed:** superseded banners on `connascence-matrix-measurement.md`,
  `creed-and-values-design-hardened.md`, `creed-and-values-design-as-proposed.md`,
  `manifesto-tier-verdict-and-handover.md`, and `squad-reports/reviewer.md`; six new rows in the
  authority's §11 register.

**Net:** nothing found moves the architecture. Everything found moves a number, a label, or a
pointer — and the two HIGH maths defects were in the *reference implementation and one bounding
sentence*, not in any adopted result. The published second-order matrices are now committed
(`_ammerse-second-order.json`), closing the one evidence gap where the most consequential
empirical claim (the false upstream derivation) was uncheckable.

**Deliberately not applied:** renumbering gates to path order (stable IDs preferred; legend added
instead); moving §9.3/§11 mechanics out of the design doc (the standalone review version handles
digestibility separately); the correlation-PSD third constraint (recorded as a candidate in §6.2,
not adopted — it is a design choice, not a fix).

## What the lenses could not verify (carried forward honestly)

- **Tracker states** (`#2466`, `#2467`, `#2532`, `#2538`, `#2591`, `#2934`, the four I2 consumers)
  — no lens audited them this round; the sequence doc's §4 collision adjudications rest on the
  planning round's checks.
- **The `#2538` rig's liveness** — still unverified by anyone; G3 decays with it (G5 exists for
  exactly this reason).
- **The upstream prose quotations** (the "decidedly not minimal" class) — the corpus JSON carries
  ids and vectors only; the 11-of-12 prose split is verified against numbers, not against the
  upstream text, which is not committed.
- **The 38→37 tiers of the corpus ladder** — upstream-only; the committed JSON starts at 36.
- **The Dirichlet ranking-collapse table** in the hardened RECORD doc — no seed or code was ever
  committed for it; it remains non-reproducible and is banner-flagged as a superseded objection.

## Lens verdicts, condensed

- **Architect:** *"Not as-is, but the gap is one editing pass, not a rewrite… the document that
  never had a review pass is carrying fewer unverifiable claims than the one that did, because it
  is the only one that cites line numbers at all."* → the editing pass is applied.
- **Patterns (fresh eyes):** *"Nothing I found moves the architecture, everything I found moves a
  number… hand it to the human reviewer, with the §0 cost table fixed first."* → fixed.
- **Debugger:** *"Reproducibility of the published figures: verified. Reproducibility of the
  evidence base, and soundness of the method carried forward into a validator: not yet."* → the
  second-order JSON is committed and the method is restart-hardened; both gaps closed.
