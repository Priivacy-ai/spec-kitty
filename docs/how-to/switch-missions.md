# How to Switch Missions

Missions shape the prompts, artifacts, and workflows Spec Kitty uses for each feature. Each feature selects one mission during `/spec-kitty.specify`, and you can inspect or start new features with a different mission at any time.

## Understanding Per-Feature Missions

- Missions are scoped per feature folder under `kitty-specs/`.
- The mission defines the workflow phases, templates, and artifacts created.
- Switching missions means creating a new feature with a different mission, not mutating an existing feature's mission.

## Mission Selection

During specification, Spec Kitty infers the mission from your prompt or lets you choose explicitly.

```bash
/spec-kitty.specify "Research market viability"
# -> Infers "research" mission
```

## Listing Available Missions

```bash
spec-kitty mission list
```

This shows all missions and highlights the active mission for the current feature.

## Getting Mission Info

```bash
spec-kitty mission info research
```

Use this to review phases, templates, and expected artifacts before you start.

## Working with Different Missions

### Software Dev Mission

Use this for product and engineering delivery.

Workflow:

- Specify -> Plan -> Tasks -> Implement -> Review

Key artifacts:

- `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks/`, WP workspaces

### Research Mission

Use this for investigations, experiments, or feasibility work.

Workflow:

- Question -> Methodology -> Gather -> Analyze -> Synthesize

Key artifacts:

- Research prompts, findings, and summary reports

### Documentation Mission

Use this when your goal is documentation coverage or quality.

Workflow:

- Audit -> Design -> Generate -> Validate

Key artifacts:

- Coverage matrix, doc plan, generated doc sets
