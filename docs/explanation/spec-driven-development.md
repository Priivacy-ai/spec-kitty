# Spec-Driven Development Explained

Spec-driven development is the methodology at the heart of Spec Kitty. This document explains what it is, why it matters, and when to use it.

## What is Spec-Driven Development?

Spec-driven development is an approach where you write a detailed specification *before* writing any code. The specification becomes the source of truth that guides implementation.

**Traditional development**:
1. Developer has an idea
2. Developer writes code
3. Developer writes documentation (maybe)
4. Requirements drift as understanding evolves

**Spec-driven development**:
1. Developer writes specification
2. Specification is reviewed and refined
3. Implementation follows specification
4. Documentation already exists (the spec)

The key insight: AI agents need clear, unambiguous requirements to produce quality output. Specifications provide that clarity.

## Why Spec-First?

### AI Agents Need Clear Requirements

Human developers can fill in gaps, ask clarifying questions mid-task, and use intuition. AI agents work better with explicit requirements:

- **Ambiguity causes inconsistency**: "Make the button look better" produces different results each time
- **Specifications reduce rework**: "Button: 44px height, #007AFF background, 12px border-radius" produces consistent results
- **Context is bounded**: AI agents work within context windows; specifications provide focused context

### Specifications Become Executable

In Spec Kitty, specifications aren't just documentation—they drive the workflow:

- `/spec-kitty.specify` creates the spec
- `/spec-kitty.plan` creates implementation plan from the spec
- `/spec-kitty.tasks` generates work packages from the plan
- Each work package references back to the spec

The specification is the contract that all agents follow.

### Reduces Rework and Misunderstanding

When multiple agents (or humans) work on a feature:
- Without spec: Each person interprets requirements differently
- With spec: Everyone references the same document

This becomes critical in parallel development where multiple AI agents implement different work packages simultaneously.

Each phase produces artifacts that feed into the next phase.

## How It Differs from Traditional Development

| Aspect | Traditional | Spec-Driven |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Requirements** | Often implicit, evolve during coding | Explicit, written upfront |
| **Documentation** | Written after implementation (often skipped) | Built into the process |
| **Parallelization** | Difficult without clear boundaries | Natural work package boundaries |
| **AI-assisted development** | Agents need context each time | Agents reference specifications |
| **Rework** | Common when requirements misunderstood | Reduced by upfront clarity |
| **Scope creep** | Easy to add "just one more thing" | Spec defines boundaries |

## When to Use Spec-Driven Development

### Good Fit

**Features with clear boundaries**:
- "Add user authentication with OAuth"
- "Implement shopping cart functionality"
- "Create admin dashboard"

**Multi-agent or team projects**:
- Multiple AI agents working in parallel
- Human + AI collaboration
- Distributed teams

**Non-trivial features**:
- More than one work package
- Requires architectural decisions
- Has integration points with existing code

### Poor Fit

**Exploratory work**:
- Prototyping where requirements are unknown
- Research tasks (use Deep Research Kitty instead)
- "Try different approaches and see what works"

**Simple one-off changes**:
- Fix a typo
- Update a single constant
- Minor refactoring

**Emergency fixes**:
- Production is down
- Security patch needed immediately
- (Write the spec after, for documentation)

## The Three Phases in Detail

### Phase 1: Specification

The specification answers: **What are we building and why?**

A good spec includes:
- **Problem statement**: What problem does this solve?
- **User stories**: Who benefits and how?
- **Requirements**: What must the solution do?
- **Non-requirements**: What is explicitly out of scope?
- **Success criteria**: How do we know we're done?

### Phase 2: Planning

The plan answers: **How will we build it?**

A good plan includes:
- **Technical approach**: Architecture and design decisions
- **Work package breakdown**: Discrete units of work
- **Dependencies**: What must be built first?
- **Risks and mitigations**: What could go wrong?

### Phase 3: Implementation

Implementation answers: **Building the actual solution.**

Each work package:
- References the spec and plan
- Has clear acceptance criteria
- Can be implemented independently
- Gets reviewed against the spec

## Why Specifications Enable Parallelization

Traditional development often becomes serial:
1. Developer A implements feature foundation
2. Developer B waits for A to finish
3. Developer B implements dependent feature
4. (Repeat)

Spec-driven development with Spec Kitty enables parallel work:
1. Specification defines all work packages upfront
2. Dependencies between WPs are explicit
3. Independent WPs can be implemented simultaneously
4. Each agent has clear scope boundaries

**Example**: A feature with 5 work packages:
- Sequential: 5 time units
- With Spec Kitty (2 parallel, 3 sequential): 3 time units
