**Issue 1**: Invalid state files are not cleared. `load_state()` returns `None` on invalid JSON, and `merge --resume` just errors with “No merge state to resume.” The requirement says invalid state should be handled gracefully by clearing and restarting. Add logic in `merge.py` (resume path) to detect invalid state and call `clear_state()` with a warning, or have `load_state()` return a sentinel so callers can clear the file.
