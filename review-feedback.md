**Issue 1**: Executor/ordering not wired in. `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/merge.py` still defines and calls `merge_workspace_per_wp()` (lines ~164, ~459, ~537), so workspace-per-WP merges continue using the old flow (numerical order) and never call `execute_merge()` from `src/specify_cli/merge/executor.py`. This means dependency ordering + executor preflight integration aren’t actually used, and merge.py is not the “thin CLI wrapper” required. Fix by replacing `merge_workspace_per_wp()` calls with `execute_merge()` and removing or demoting the old function so ordering is applied.

**Issue 2**: Executor does not cover legacy path as required. The work package explicitly says “Executor must handle both workspace-per-WP and legacy modes,” but `execute_merge()` only takes `wp_workspaces` and is only suitable for workspace-per-WP. Legacy merge logic remains in `merge.py`. Either extend executor to support legacy merges (and call it from `merge.py`) or update the design to clearly consolidate both paths into executor.
