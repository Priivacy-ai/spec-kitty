**Issue 1**: `docs/how-to/merge-feature.md` does not meet the T026 requirement for the See Also section. It should include a direct link to `../explanation/workspace-per-wp.md` (currently only in Background). Please add the required See Also link to match the WP guidance.

**Issue 2**: Merge strategy documentation is inconsistent. `docs/how-to/merge-feature.md` states rebase is not supported, but the Command Reference table lists `rebase`, and `docs/how-to/accept-and-merge.md` includes `--strategy rebase` in the Merge Strategies list. Please align these sections to avoid contradictory guidance (remove rebase or clearly mark it unsupported).
