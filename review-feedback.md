**Issue 1**: Preflight is skipped if the current worktree is dirty, so it won’t “show all issues upfront.” In `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/merge.py` the `verify` step runs before workspace-per-WP detection and exits on local uncommitted changes. This prevents `run_preflight()` from aggregating dirty worktrees across the feature. Fix by moving the dirty-check to the legacy (single-worktree) path only, or by deferring it until after `detect_worktree_structure()` and skipping it when `structure == "workspace-per-wp"` so preflight always runs first for workspace-per-WP.

**Issue 2**: Missing worktrees aren’t reported. `run_preflight()` only inspects worktrees found on disk (`find_wp_worktrees()`), so if one WP worktree is missing (the review edge case), preflight still passes and the merge proceeds with an incomplete set. Add a check to compare expected WP IDs (from tasks/frontmatter) against discovered worktrees and report missing ones as errors in `PreflightResult`.
