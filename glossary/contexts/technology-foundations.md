## Context: Technology Foundations

General technology terms that appear throughout Spec Kitty documentation. Included here so that readers unfamiliar with these concepts have a clear reference point.

### API

| | |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | Application Programming Interface — a defined way for one piece of software to talk to another. Instead of a human clicking buttons, an API lets programs send requests and receive structured responses. |

### CLI

| | |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | Command Line Interface — a text-based way to interact with software by typing commands into a terminal, rather than clicking through a graphical interface. Spec Kitty's primary interface is a CLI. |

### UI

| | |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | User Interface — any surface through which a person interacts with software. This can be graphical (buttons, windows) or text-based (a CLI). |

### Markdown

| | |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | A lightweight text formatting language that uses simple symbols (like `#` for headings and `**` for bold) to create readable documents. Files use the `.md` extension. |

### YAML

| | |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | A human-readable configuration file format that uses indentation and key-value pairs to structure data. Files use the `.yaml` or `.yml` extension. Used in Spec Kitty for mission definitions and project configuration. |

### JSON

| | |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | A structured data format using curly braces and key-value pairs, commonly used for machine-to-machine communication. Less human-readable than YAML but widely supported by programming tools. |

### SHA256

| | |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | A hashing algorithm that produces a fixed-length checksum from any input. Even a tiny change in the input produces a completely different checksum, making it useful for detecting whether content has been modified. |
