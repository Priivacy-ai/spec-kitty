# Historical Terms and Mappings

| Historical term | Current term | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AI agent tooling (runtime executable) | Tool | Use "tool" for concrete products such as Claude Code/Codex/opencode. |
| Agent identity/profile language | Agent | Use "agent" for logical collaborator identity and role. |
| Feature as runtime primary identity | Mission Run (target), Feature (2.x compatibility) | 2.x still uses feature slugs heavily in artifacts; runtime identity work moves toward mission-run scoping. |
| Ad-hoc term definitions in prompts | Canonical glossary entries + append-only events | Preserve decisions and replay history. |
