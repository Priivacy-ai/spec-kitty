$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and capture `FEATURE_DIR` plus `AVAILABLE_DOCS`. All paths must be absolute.

   **CRITICAL**: The script returns JSON with `FEATURE_DIR` as an ABSOLUTE path (e.g., `/Users/robert/Code/new_specify/specs/001-feature-name`).

   **YOU MUST USE THIS PATH** for ALL subsequent file operations. Example:
   ```
   FEATURE_DIR = "/Users/robert/Code/new_specify/specs/001-a-simple-hello"
   tasks.md location: FEATURE_DIR + "/tasks.md"
   prompt location: FEATURE_DIR + "/tasks/planned/WP01-slug.md"
   ```

   **DO NOT CREATE** paths like:
   - ❌ `tasks/planned/WP01-slug.md` (missing FEATURE_DIR prefix)
   - ❌ `/tasks/planned/WP01-slug.md` (wrong root)
   - ❌ `WP01-slug.md` (wrong directory)

2. **Load design documents** from `FEATURE_DIR` (only those present):
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech architecture, stack), spec.md (user stories & priorities)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API schemas), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (validation scenarios)
   - Scale your effort to the feature: simple UI tweaks deserve lighter coverage, multi-system releases require deeper decomposition.

3. **Derive fine-grained subtasks** (IDs `T001`, `T002`, ...):
   - Parse plan/spec to enumerate concrete implementation steps, tests (only if explicitly requested), migrations, and operational work.
   - Capture prerequisites, dependencies, and parallelizability markers (`[P]` means safe to parallelize per file/concern).
   - Maintain the subtask list internally; it feeds the work-package roll-up and the prompts.

4. **Roll subtasks into work packages** (IDs `WP01`, `WP02`, ...):
   - Target 4–10 work packages. Each should be independently implementable, rooted in a single user story or cohesive subsystem.
   - Ensure every subtask appears in exactly one work package.
   - Name each work package with a succinct goal (e.g., “User Story 1 – Real-time chat happy path”).
   - Record per-package metadata: priority, success criteria, risks, dependencies, and list of included subtasks.

5. **Write `tasks.md`** using `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md`:
   - **Location**: Write to `FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md` (use the absolute FEATURE_DIR path from step 1)
   - Populate the Work Package sections (setup, foundational, per-story, polish) with the `WPxx` entries
   - Under each work package include:
     - Summary (goal, priority, independent test)
     - Included subtasks (checkbox list referencing `Txxx`)
     - Implementation sketch (high-level sequence)
     - Parallel opportunities, dependencies, and risks
   - Preserve the checklist style so implementers can mark progress

6. **Generate prompt files (one per work package)**:
   - **CRITICAL PATH RULE**: All task directories and prompt files MUST be created under `FEATURE_DIR/tasks/`, NOT in the repo root!
   - Correct structure: `FEATURE_DIR/tasks/planned/WPxx-slug.md`, `FEATURE_DIR/tasks/doing/`, `FEATURE_DIR/tasks/for_review/`, `FEATURE_DIR/tasks/done/`
   - WRONG (do not create): `/tasks/planned/`, `tasks/planned/`, or any path not under FEATURE_DIR
   - Ensure `FEATURE_DIR/tasks/planned/` exists (create `FEATURE_DIR/tasks/doing/`, `FEATURE_DIR/tasks/for_review/`, `FEATURE_DIR/tasks/done/` if missing)
   - Create optional phase subfolders under each lane when teams will benefit (e.g., `FEATURE_DIR/tasks/planned/phase-1-setup/`)
   - For each work package:
     - Derive a kebab-case slug from the title; filename: `WPxx-slug.md`
     - Full path example: `FEATURE_DIR/tasks/planned/WP01-create-html-page.md` (use ABSOLUTE path from FEATURE_DIR variable)
     - Use `.specify/templates/task-prompt-template.md` to capture:
       - Frontmatter with `work_package_id`, `subtasks` array, `lane=planned`, history entry
       - Objective, context, detailed guidance per subtask
       - Test strategy (only if requested)
       - Definition of Done, risks, reviewer guidance
     - Update `tasks.md` to reference the prompt filename
   - Keep prompts exhaustive enough that a new agent can complete the work package unaided

7. **Report**: Provide a concise outcome summary:
   - Path to `tasks.md`
   - Work package count and per-package subtask tallies
   - Parallelization highlights
   - MVP scope recommendation (usually Work Package 1)
  - Prompt generation stats (files written, directory structure, any skipped items with rationale)
   - Next suggested command (e.g., `/speckitty.analyze` or `/speckitty.implement`)

Context for work-package planning: {ARGS}

The combination of `tasks.md` and the bundled prompt files must enable a new engineer to pick up any work package and deliver it end-to-end without further specification spelunking.

## Task Generation Rules

**Tests remain optional**. Only include testing tasks/steps if the feature spec or user explicitly demands them.

1. **Subtask derivation**:
   - Assign IDs `Txxx` sequentially in execution order.
   - Use `[P]` for parallel-safe items (different files/components).
   - Include migrations, data seeding, observability, and operational chores.

2. **Work package grouping**:
   - Map subtasks to user stories or infrastructure themes.
   - Keep each work package laser-focused on a single goal; avoid mixing unrelated stories.
   - Do not exceed 10 work packages. Merge low-effort items into broader bundles when necessary.

3. **Prioritisation & dependencies**:
   - Sequence work packages: setup → foundational → story phases (priority order) → polish.
   - Call out inter-package dependencies explicitly in both `tasks.md` and the prompts.

4. **Prompt composition**:
   - Mirror subtask order inside the prompt.
   - Provide actionable implementation and test guidance per subtask—short for trivial work, exhaustive for complex flows.
   - Surface risks, integration points, and acceptance gates clearly so reviewers know what to verify.

5. **Think like a tester**: Any vague requirement should be tightened until a reviewer can objectively mark it done or not done.
