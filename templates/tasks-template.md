# Work Packages: [FEATURE NAME]

**Inputs**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Only include explicit testing work when stakeholders request it.

**Organization**: Fine-grained subtasks (`Txxx`) roll up into work packages (`WPxx`). Each work package must be independently deliverable and testable.

**Prompt Files**: Each work package references a matching prompt file in `/tasks/planned/` generated by `/speckitty.tasks`. Treat this file as the high-level checklist; keep deep implementation detail inside the prompt files.

## Subtask Format: `[Txxx] [P?] Description`
- **[P]** indicates the subtask can proceed in parallel (different files/components).
- Include precise file paths or modules.

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/`
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/`, `android/src/`
- Adjust paths to match the implementation plan.

## Work Package WP01: Setup & Environment (Priority: P0)

**Goal**: Establish project skeleton and shared tooling.
**Independent Test**: Project bootstraps locally with linting and formatter hooks in place.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/planned/WP01-setup-and-environment.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

### Implementation Notes
- Major steps, commands, or configuration files required.

### Parallel Opportunities
- Highlight subtasks that can proceed concurrently.

### Dependencies
- None (starting package).

### Risks & Mitigations
- Example: Tooling compatibility across contributors; pin versions in `.tool-versions`.

---

## Work Package WP02: Foundational Platform (Priority: P0)

**Goal**: Deliver shared services all user stories depend on.
**Independent Test**: Foundational services pass smoke tests; downstream work packages can start.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/planned/WP02-foundational-platform.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities shared across stories
- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management

### Implementation Notes
- Provide sequencing, infrastructure CLI commands, secrets requirements.

### Parallel Opportunities
- Authentication and routing can proceed in parallel once schema scaffolding exists.

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP01.

### Risks & Mitigations
- Migration drift â†’ enforce migration linting in CI.

## Work Package WP03: User Story 1 â€“ [Title] (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of story outcome]
**Independent Test**: [Describe how to validate the story independently]
**Prompt**: `/tasks/planned/WP03-user-story-1.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T010 [P] Contract test for [endpoint] in `tests/contract/test_[name].py`
- [ ] T011 [P] Integration test for [journey] in `tests/integration/test_[name].py`
- [ ] T012 [P] Create [Entity1] model in `src/models/[entity1].py`
- [ ] T013 [P] Create [Entity2] model in `src/models/[entity2].py`
- [ ] T014 Implement [Service] in `src/services/[service].py` (depends on T012, T013)
- [ ] T015 Implement [endpoint/feature] in `src/[location]/[file].py`
- [ ] T016 Add validation and error handling
- [ ] T017 Add story-specific logging and metrics

### Implementation Notes
- Enumerate the workflow (tests first if required, then models â†’ services â†’ endpoints).

### Parallel Opportunities
- Mention any subtasks that can be split among engineers safely.

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP02.

### Risks & Mitigations
- Data integrity risk â†’ include migration rollback plan.

## Work Package WP0N: Polish & Cross-Cutting (Priority: Px)

**Goal**: Cross-story improvements and hardening work.
**Independent Test**: Regression suite passes; observability and documentation updated.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/planned/WP0N-polish-and-cross-cutting.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T0XX Documentation updates in `docs/`
- [ ] T0XX Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] T0XX Performance optimization across stories
- [ ] T0XX Security hardening
- [ ] T0XX Validate quickstart.md scenario

### Implementation Notes
- Capture finishing touches and validation guidance.

### Parallel Opportunities
- Identify items safe to run alongside final story testing.

### Dependencies
- Depends on completion of relevant story packages.

### Risks & Mitigations
- Regression risk â†’ enforce smoke test before release.

---

## Dependency & Execution Summary

- **Sequence**: WP01 â†’ WP02 â†’ Story-driven packages (priority order) â†’ WP0N polish.
- **Parallelization**: Highlight safe parallel combinations once prerequisites complete.
- **MVP Scope**: Call out which work packages constitute the minimal release.
